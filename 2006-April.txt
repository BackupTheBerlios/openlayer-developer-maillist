Subject: [Openlayer-developer] OpenLayer thanks!
Message-ID: <442E42C2.1010000@reflectedgames.com>

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to thank all those who have worked on OpenLayer besides 
Esa for their great work. OpenLayer is already very useful and I see the 
proposed changes as being very exciting!

Can I enquire about the idea of adding DirectX support? Is this still 
going to happen? :)

Cheers!
Richard.

Just in case no one is aware of these..

1) I tried to load a png with a width of 8 pixels and OpenLayer failed. 
I had to use 16 pixels in width to get it to work.
2) The create Poly Collision from a bitmap code locks up badly if there 
is no transparent space around the edges of the image.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] Problems with creating collision polygons.
Message-ID: <442E5158.5000608@reflectedgames.com>

I'm trying to create some collsion polygons and OpenLayer just gets 
locked up. I have to Ctrl+Alt+End to abort.

I have 2 simple mask images which I am loading with:
maskImages = Bitmap::LoadListOfBitmaps("Masks/", "png", 3, 
CREATE_COLLISION_POLY);

The logfile:

Loading bitmap: Masks/001.png
Creating collision polygon (Number of skips between vertices: 0)
OpenGL extension GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two was not found.
Loading bitmap: Masks/002.png
Creating collision polygon (Number of skips between vertices: 0)

It seems to get stuck on the second image which is pretty simple. I've 
tried saving with a magic pink background, with a alpha colour and tried 
altering the collision accuracy to 1.0, but nothing helps.

I've uploaded the images (which appear invisible due to the transparancy):

Does anyone know why this is going wrong? :(

Rich.

Hmm... the second image loads just fine with the collision polygon for me... 
But thanks for informing about the issues, maybe I can find the cause.

Damn, neither of those happen to me... So it's hard to find the issue once 
again. Maybe I could make a debug version of OL so that you could test it 
and tell where the problem occurs?

I've uploaded an image which shows the collision problem I am having.

The cross image on the right is the 1st mask image I uploaded, while the 
image on the left is the resulting collision poly when I draw it to the 
screen.

Hope that helps track the problem down!

Message-ID: <44310593.4090703@reflectedgames.com>

Ok,

I've got a bit more of an idea about this error! I previously used 
OpenLayer 1.93 and loaded a series of font images with 
LoadListOfBitmaps. This worked fine and I had no problems. However when 
I tried this again with OpenLayer 2.0 it crashes on some images. From 
looking at the images it fails in they seem to be 16 pixels in width or 
less. I've tried with the later CVS version of OpenLayer from Neil 
Walker and it still crashes as well as the link in Esa's Allegro sig on 
SourceForge.

Was something changed in the loading part to not work with 16 pixel width?

Just to be sure, I recompiled an old 1.93 project with these images with 
the official 2.0 lib and whereas before it worked perfectly, it now crashes.

Hope that helps..
Rich.

Yes, it's an old bug and it's been fixed months ago... Great that you could 
make a new release for MSVC, the SVN version contains so many important 
improvements!

About the mailing lists - I'll have to ask birdeeoh about that. I really 
don't know much about Berlios actually...

Esa,

The latest version you sent me still brings up faulty bitmap->polygon 
results. Are you aware of that too? Sorry, I don't want to give you 
nothing but problems, but the quicker it's stable the more people will 
feel confident with using it. :)

No worries, everytime I go to make a release, a big fecker of a bug 
appears and I stop. The last one was the linethingy bug that we 
eventually found.

Can you tell me how you put together the library with msvc? As in how, I mean

I currently have the build system building it for gcc and it's variants and 
would very much like to automate the build process for msvc. With that it 
will help others and probably can help you make your releases if you so 
desire. :)

Esa I don't know if my message got through last time, basically:

I'd have to say that having the GlyphKeeper dependency is the pita. How 
difficult would it be to implement and use FreeType in OpenLayer? I would 
assist in the transition if you want to pursue it, just need to know what has 
to be done. As you already said the added benefits definitely outweigh the 
negatives. :)

I'm sure an nmake file can be made quite easily. But at the minute it 
isn't worth it as it usually takes about an hour of recoding the library 
and samples to get it to work with MSVC every time I do a new build. The 
bugs are getting less though, thankfully :)

The main one is figuring out why the std versions min/max don't work in 
VC, I'm sure it's just a header file ordering but there are quite a few 
nested headers in OL making it difficult to trace the fault.

Neil.

Hello,
This is directed to the mailing list administrator :)

In the mailing list preferences, is there any chance you can set the 
following, which will make it easier and safer:

1. obfuscate the mail address in the archive view (to stop our email 
addresses from being found)

3. turn on the option to only send to a person once (if you do reply all

I've got these on in my mailing list and it makes things loads nicer.

Having 1, 2 & 3 set would make it much nicer for me as well! :)

Hey guys,

Sorry I haven't been paying much attn the last week or two, I've been 
caught up in preparing for a life altering job interview  ;)

Neil et al -
-The only option I could figure for the archive was to make it private..
-There is only one option I could find regarding obfuscating email 
addresses so they aren't harvestable, and that option is checked...
-I changed the reply-to address to the list instead of the original sender.

That directly answers one of the requests... the others, well...

Neil - which system do you use?  Berlios uses mailman.  I can hunt more 
in depth later this evening/tommorrow morning.  Lemme know if you have 
any tips!  :)

Hello,
The reply to now seems to work which is great. so just doing reply will 
now work fixing two problems in one :)

I don't think the email hiding is working though, what happens is it 
changes the addresses so they are written as text without @, in my 
version of mailman it's in the Privacy section called 'Show member 
addresses so they're not directly recognizable as email addresses?'

I guess making it private makes sense, otherwise you wouldn't have a 
subscribe option.

Keep up the good work :)

Neil.

It's hard to say how difficult it may be before taking a look at Freetype. 
Probably it won't be
a big task, and I know it'd also allow for improving the TextRenderer API a 
lot. Also many installing problems are related to GK.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] antialiasing problem
Message-ID: <443583F2.3080508@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
In my program I'm doing this:
    if(!Setup::SetupProgram())
        return false;
    if(!Setup::SetupScreen(640,480,false))
        return false;

    Settings::SetAntialiasing(true);

Then I'm loading some bitmaps (standard 32bit bmp files) using the 
load("file.bmp") syntax (i.e. no alpha-channel, etc).

When I blit the bitmap all is well as you'd expect. However, when I 
change antialiasing to false, all that I get is a white rectangle in 
place of every bitmap. I resaved the bmp using mspaint as a png file and 
it did the same thing.

Is this the mailing list place to discuss problems or should I use the 
user list instead?

Neil.

Hello,
According to the manual for the GetCollisionPoly method it returns a 
CollisionPoly pointer and there is a reference to the CollisionPoly 
class. But there doesn't seem to be a CollisionPoly class. 
GetCollisionPoly in the code returns a Poly. Am I seeing things?

IIRC Esa says it returns a normal poly and so can be used for drawing as 
well as with the poly<->poly collision code.

Maybe it's in a later version then as I've scanned the entire code and 
there's no CollisionPoly class, yet the manual says so?

Another minor discrepency is the manual states only the Bitmap 
constructor has the flags parameter (e.g. MAKE_COLLISION_POLY) and Load 
doesn't, but looking at the Load declaration it does, even though I 
can't figure out where it creates the collision poly ;)

What I'm trying to figure out is how to generate a collision poly for a 
bitmap that you create using a sub-bitmap but I don't know how. Any 
ideas? the bitmap constructor for this doesn't take any flags and I 
can't figure out how to create a collision poly from the manual.

Neil.

As far as I can see GetCollisionPoly() returns the already created poly 
from the constructor/load if make_collision_poly was set, but all the 
make_collision_poly flag does in the constructor/load for a bitmap is 
calls GetCollisionPoly(...) static, which is a public which does the 
actual creation of the poly, so I guess even though it's not documented 
I should be able to call the static method with valid parameters to 
create a collision poly on a bitmap after it has been created? But there 
must be a reason why it isn't documented. Otherwise you can't create a 
collision poly easily on already loaded bitmaps/bitmaps you create on 
the fly/sub bitmaps.

Neil,

It may just be that the manual has not yet been updated. It could also 
be that Esa intends to write a public wrapper function around 
GetCollisionPoly().
At present the function doesn't produce the correct results for me 
anyway. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.

hmm. my problem is I've converted my Animation system completely to 
openlayer (and it's pretty good I think), but one of the options is to 
work with tiled bitmaps and without the ability to create collision 
poly's, it sort of scuppers my plans. I suppose I could just make do 
with a bounding box for now.

Hello,
I don't know if this is of any use and there would be synchronisation 
problems with the offline version (nothing that a html grab wouldn't 
fix), but how about making the online version of the manual wiki-fied? 
that way it'll be easy for any of the developers (or subscribed people 
if so wished) to update the manual and add samples, etc.

I haven't looked into wiki myself, but I know there is a wiki php 
library that should be fairly easy to do.

Any thoughts?

Neil.

That sounds good to me. I'd make it that only registered users can make 
changes though.

Exactly why it would be suitable to go ahead and implement native glyph 
routines without having to rely on GK.
For the most part it's either hit or miss when compiling GK. 
Relying only on freetype would be less of a burden then having to rely on 
both.
I'm unfamiliar with the freetype API, but I'm sure we can probably cannabilize 
some of the methods from GK and actually add improvements suitable to OL.
When I get a chance I'll go through the FreeType API and look at what could be 
done and report what I find here. :)

This is a good idea which will allow community involvement in documentation.
Long before I suggested using doxygen for documentation however it becomes 
tedious to maintain and clutters the source code and more than likely hinders 
development.
Although there is still the issue of actually dumping the pages for offline 
viewing and such. I'm sure there is a wiki out there that provides this 
functionality and just needs to be researched. If this is the direction esa 
and brady would like to take, as I see you and richard seem to like the idea 
I can set one up as I've set some up before.

Ugh figures, then until that gap is met were it compiles cleanly under gcc and 
msvc I'll leave out the build target for it.

Indeed one thing that would help is to comb through the source and clean up 
small things such as that.
My main concern is to be able to get it to the point where you don't have to 
recode at all. It should be straightforward so that any individual can grab 
the source and compile it on their platfrom/environment of choice. And if so 
desired you can still retain your binary releases without headache and on 
time. :)

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] bug in allegro conversion
Message-ID: <4436EBC4.3030804@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
I have a bitmap that I've loaded as an allegro bitmap and have tried to 
convert it to an OL bitmap as follows:

BITMAP* tmp=load_bmp(filename.c_str(),NULL);
if(tmp)
  Image=new Bitmap(tmp,/CONVERT_MAGIC_PINK/);

It crashes on the constructor. If I change it slightly to use the load 
method but the same thing:

BITMAP* tmp=load_bmp(filename.c_str(),NULL);
if(tmp)
{
  Image=new Bitmap(tmp->w,tmp->h,Rgba::INVISIBLE);
  Image->Load(tmp,false,true);
}

It crashes on the Load again.

However, If I change it to not use magic pink,
  Image->Load(tmp,false,false);

It doesn't crash, but the image is completely empty. If I change 
Rgba::INVISIBLE to a colour, it is still blank.

I've tried various images, with and without magic pink background, but 
they all fail. Am I doing something completely stupid as I'm sure 
someone must have tested this allegro conversion ;)

Neil,

I had something similar. I ended up using this:

// Make sure any magic pink pixels have this value though: 
makeacol32(255, 0, 255, 0));
bmp.Load(area, true, false);

bmp being a Bitmap.
&
area being a BITMAP *

Hope that helps!
Rich.

There is, I do it at my mailing list using mailman. If someone gives me 
the passwords temporarily I'll modify the settings to work. What you end 
up doing is the sender is show as the modified email , e.g. 'name at 
blah.com' and the reply-to header is changed to the mailing list when 
you click reply, and when you do reply-all you get both names in the 
email but the one to the individual is ignored.

Doesn't that mean I have to modify the bitmaps? sort of defeats the 
object of keeping magic pink then. hmm. Maybe I could do a search and 
replace in code. I find it hard to believe stuff like this hasn't been 
fixed yet. And I'm still having loads of problems (everything turning 
white!) with anti-aliasing off as well :(

I'll write some code and try it out. Tomorrow though, I'm off to bed now.

OK, you guys type faster than I can read these posts ;)

Firstly, there's no such thing as a CollisionPoly, it's a typo in the 
manual. Such thing was planned in the beginning, but things changed.

Secondly, the magic pink conversion might have been broken when all the 
Allegro stuff was moved to neat containers, to allow for SDL targets, for 
example. Why it's not fixed - that's because it hasn't been detected before. 
I originally left out the magic pink conversion in early versions of OL for 
a reason - it's not 80's anymore, guys! Magic pink transparency hasn't been 
used in commercial products like, a dozen of years? For some reason 
allegroids still think it's a good and fresh idea, maybe because Allegro 
uses it. But I know it should be fixed right away, could you just send me 
the images that you can't load?

About the collision polygon generation. Creating the collision polygon 
requires a memory copy of the Bitmap. However, no such thing exist after the 
constructor/Load-method call. So there's no way the sub-bitmap constructor 
would get the memory copy*. However, the flag parameters should be listed in 
the Load methods, I'll go and add them there.

And finally about the Wiki - if someone wants to set one up and somehow move 
the manual there, go ahead ;) I also think that if a Wiki is set up, only 
registered members should be able to modify it...

* Actually, there is, but it won't work with older GFX cards if the image is 
too large

Oh, forgot about the AA issue. I think I found what the issue might be (no 
default texture parameters allowed by the drivers) and it could be fixed 
now. Let's see when I get the SVN version updated.

Thanks. As for the sub-bitmap, how are you supposed to support 
tiled/sheet graphics without being able to create a collision poly? one 
of the major reasons for using sub-bitmaps is for extracting tiled graphics.

As for the magic pink, I want my routine to fully support allegro and OL 
transparently and be able to load bitmaps like this, which is why I want 
it working. Plus it's easy to see the magic pink when you're drawing ;)

If you think the wiki will be of use and not hamper the offline 
documentation or become out of sync then I'll do it.

If you want images then 
http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/nwalker/axl/AXL_Projects1.2src.rar

Navigate to the tests/animation/gfx directory and fill your boots. The 
sheet.bmp is a tiled version of the single bitmaps.

Neil.

btw, did I mention that when you do call the the constructor with the 
option to generate a collision poly on these single magic pink graphics, 
it crashes?

For now you could split the image in Allegro before conversion. Later an 
automatic function to split a memory image to Bitmaps might be implemented.

Well, the transparency is just as easy to see if you set the background 
layer to magic pink. For the collision polygon generation not working with 
magic pink - that's because OL doesn't currently know that the magic pink is 
the transparency in the generation routine. Once again something I've forgot 
to test because I never use magic pink transparency anymore.

>If you think the wiki will be of use and not hamper the offline

Yeah, of course I'd have to synchronize the offline manual every now and 
then. Or, I could just use wget etc. to grab a copy of the Wiki.

ok. when I say magic pink, really you can think of it as a bitmap that 
is full of pixels with no transparency at the edges as I was just 
loading the bitmaps as if they were normal bitmaps and the pink was just 
another colour - didn't Rich have a fault where he had to have at least 
the edge with transparency?

I'll do the sub bitmap split as you say, but I guess the problem is I 
was using sub-bitmaps for efficiency and I'll have to rewrite my code. 
Not to worry.

Neil.

btw, is there much difference internally (I don't know how opengl works)

Why not just add a simple routine in OpenLayer to convert any Magic Pink 
pixels to have an alpha value of 0? (possibly making the colour black as 
well). Then call this function where necessary from any of the load and 
create methods.

I'm sure all these bug reports are annoying, but making OpenLayer more 
stable will only be good in the long run. :)

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] collision polygons
Message-ID: <4437739C.6050109@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
I've got to be perfectly honest and say I don't know the difference 
between the Collision object and a polygon collision, so this might all 
be done, but for my collisions I'm using the poly.collides method and 
not the collision class for my bitmaps. How about a method, e.g. 
CreateCollisionPoly(...) that has a few overloaded signatures that lets 
you post create a bitmap's collision poly from a Poly object, a filename 
for a text file that contains a series of vectors, or maybe a
'bool Settings::GenerateBoundingBox' to automatically generate a simply 
bounding box poly for every bitmap. All the collision poly is, is just a 
Poly so I can't see a problem with this.

But like I said, I don't really know what the Collision object does, but 
I guess there must be a big one, otherwise it wouldn't exist :)

To overcome the problems with the CREATE_COLLISION_POLY I've just been 
creating a poly for my sprites as a bounding box and using the poly 
collides method.

I think that's what it roughly does (Bitmap.cpp, roughly line 620), what 
I can't understand in the code is why it checks for alpha channels if 
you pass in the magic pink flag. I would have thought these were 
mutually exclusive.

Maybe it's the way things are done in the C++ world, but I find some of 
the stuff like this and the shape class pretty confusing. I understand 
that you want to keep it using these classes, but is there not a way to 
simplify things, or at least explain a bit more in the docs? :-/

That's what I tried to say in the allegro.cc thread about the 
documentation when Esa got upset ;)

I don't mind the separate classes as it means you can use them for 
different purposes (e.g. Vec2D) but it's the confusion between their 
role/interaction with the other classes, e.g. 
Collision/CollisionPoly/Poly and the overlapping ways of doing things 
e.g. Bitmap.xxx/Placement/Transform.

I think I've got the hang of most of these now, it's just collision/poly 
I'm not following.

But if we're talking about confusing things, and I guess this is just a 
coding practice, but I think it would be much easier to follow the code 
if all the methods (including constructors/destructors) were moved to 
the .cpp file and the .hpp left for the declarations/enums. It's a right 
pain tracing a bit of code, but at least it's coded in English ;)

Hello,
Does anyone trust me enough to give me an account? I've made a few minor 
changes (well, just one so far - to rename the PointerAlpha.png to 
Pointer.png) for the shapedemo - otherwise the demo code won't compile, 
but I only got the SVN down via anonymous.

Also, I mentioned this in allegro.cc - with the latest version of SVN 
the linestrip demo doesn't work anymore. I'll try and trace the fault 
but I think it's got something to do with the changes to the 
shape.hpp/cpp file. Basically, you don't get line strips anymore, only a 
couple of dots. Means I can't do a release yet again!

Just a suggestion for the OL hero's - the ordering of where the code is 
being stored (hpp/cpp) is getting a bit messy, any chance when you get 
time you can make it more consistent, like put all the code in the cpp 
files, or at least put all constructors in header files?

Neil.

Hello,
Found the fault. It's the change made in linestrip.hpp to fix the fault 
in MSVC that I mentioned last week. Except now the change makes mingw 
linestrips not work!

Basically it's in addtoend/addtobegin where vertices.push_front/back is 
moved to before the for loop. Logically this should work and it does 
with MSVC but it now fails with mingw, except instead of crashing like 
MSVC does, you simply don't get any linestrips, only the last one. 
Simply compile the linestrip demo and try it.

Don't know how to fix it though :)

Neil.

Sorry guys!  I've been very occupied this week and am just catching up 
on stuff.

I made the changes you pointed out Neil - hopefully this post I'm making 
now will show that it works now...

don't know if this makes any sense, but I can't figure it out. At 
vertices count of two the linestrip is showing ok.
http://retrospec.sgn.net/1.jpg

At a count of three it seems to lose the link between the second and 
third vertice.
http://retrospec.sgn.net/2.jpg

 From then on I don't really know what is happening, it appears to be 
losing everything apart from the first and the (possibly) last:
http://retrospec.sgn.net/3.jpg

The number on the screen is the number of vertices. I think the problem 
is the link between vertices and lengths is being lost.

That's exactly what OL does (in fact it does more - it interpolates the 
transparent pixels so that no color bleeding happens with AA). However, the 
problem here is that the conversion happens, due to a bug, after the 
collision polygon is created, not before.

Collision objects are the results of a collision. A Poly object is always a 
collision polygon as well (in other words, Poly <-> Poly collision is 
defined). I could implement a method to change a Bitmap's collision polygon. 
But after all, the collision Poly has to be retrieved from the Bitmap before 
doing to collision test. No separate Bitmap <-> Bitmap collision is defined. 
Also I'm going to implement extra bounding boxes and bounding circles for 
Polys to make the collision tests more efficient.

You may specify both CONVERT_MAGIC_PINK and HAS_ALPHA_CHANNEL flags. That 
means that magic pink pixels are totally transparent, but otherwise the 
alpha channel specifies the opacity.

... which would sacrifice efficiency and someone would complain OL getting 
slower.

About the meanings of different parts of OL:

- Transforms: Mainly intended to transform the contents of the whole screen
- Placement: Holds a transformation state (position, rotation and stretch)
- Bitmap::BlitXX: Does the actual drawing. In the future there will be 
BlitTransformed( Placement &)

- Bitmap::GetCollisionPoly: Returns the generated collision polygon, which 
is a Poly
- Poly: A polygon object, handles rendering polygons and collisions between 
them
- Collision: The results of a collision, returned by Poly::GetCollision. 
Stores the exact position of the collision, the colliding line segments and 
the normals of the colliding objects at the point of collision.

The docs explain why the classes are used instead of simple methods: To 
allow for better code readability, helps remembering things, the methods in 
the base classes can be used in the derived classes and it makes extending 
the system a lot easier. For example, instead of having 98 (!) overloaded 
versions of GetCollision and Collides (almost 200 separate functions in 
total, huh!), I can just have Shape::GetCollision( Shape & ) and 
Shape::Collides( Shape & )

I don't know how the collision code works, but I imagine a poly check is 
fairly intensive, and because most collision will be bitmap based why 
not store a Rect for each bitmap that is the bounding box (as well as 
any extra collision poly) and have a bitmap-bitmap collision that 
internally does a bounding box followed by a collision poly check if 
there is one. This'll make it much easier to code without having to call 
separate poly methods and should be faster. There's nothing really 
stopping you from doing this for the primitives either as it should 
speed up most tests.

btw, do the collision poly's change when your bitmap changes, e.g. 
stretching, distorting, etc?

As for the type of wiki I was thinking more on the lines of: 
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki
It can export to pdf and has other ease of use features. As it is specifically 
geared towards development I can say this would be the best choice.
That is of course if the devs agree about migrating the documentation.
If a mutual agreement is reached, I'll set it up asap.

How does the Bitmap "change"? If you draw the Bitmap to the screen rotated, 
then it'll seem rotated. But you can't really modify the Bitmap in any 
way... Also the reason why I wouldn't want to implement Bitmap <-> Bitmap 
collisions is because that'd mean that separate Shape <-> Bitmap and Bitmap 
<-> Shape methods would be needed as well. And as the Poly will have a 
bounding box, too, so what's the difference?

>This'll make it much easier to code without having to call separate poly 
>methods

Eh, I don't know if it's much easier after all. Now you just need one extra 
call to retrieve the collision polygon from the Bitmap.

Sounds good. Also what about having a hints-section in the manual page, or 
something? Also maybe a how-to section would be good too (which would have 
some kind of tutorials for how to do things like post-rendering effects, 
clipping to arbitarily shaped regions, collision detection and response and 
using Shapes.

Well setup is complete. :)
I've added you, brady and neil for now, just request new logins when you get 
to the login page and it'll send you a new password via email.
Logins:
Esa - fladimir
Brady - brady
neil - neil
I've also added a basic layout so that you can get a feel for how it works.
If you don't like the wiki we can use something else, but I think this wiki 
provides every need that a developer can use.
Not overly complex nor too simple. :)
Oh and here's the address:
http://openlayer.berlios.de/dokuwiki
Check out the syntax links to view syntax and other usefull help. :)
Enjoy.

OK, now the only thing missing is the content ;)

It's also a bit on the slow side right now, with a 10 Mb connection it takes 
about 10-15 seconds to load a page...

I didn't know you could do it within berlios, I was just about to 
install it on the retrospec machine. Just let me know if you want to 
move it there, but it seems fast enough to me.

Everytime I got the edit page it logs me out and won't let me edit.

I'll do some reading, but can you do stuff like create side menus and stuff?

Spoke too soon. Maybe the best thing to get started is to download one 
of the pre-made templates:

sorry i haven't been around lately, i've been quite busy with school -n-
work.  looks like the wiki was done with DokuWiki.  If you need any help
with it, i have my own dokuwiki, i'd be glad to share some pointers and
such.

The only thing I can think of from my brief look is can we somehow 
modify the geshi plugin to automatically link to the correct wiki api 
pages? that'll make the documentation much better.

i've never tried adding links within the code blocks, so yea the plugin
itself would need modification.  I'm fairly sure its been done with geishi
before though.

changes? I'd like to make minor changes to get it working with MSVC, and 
I think I've got the hang of tortoise. I don't mind if not, it just 
means I'll post my code changes here.

Just a couple of minor things on the SVN you put in Esa, You've added 
TexturedPoly.hpp to the main header file but it doesn't exist.

Neil.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] cracked the MSVC std::min problem
Message-ID: <443AE6F9.1060701@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
The problem with MSVC not compiling is that min/max are already defined 
by windows. I found the fix here:
http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/14540

On checking, mingw (inside osdefines) already makes this call. So can 
anyone think of a reason why it won't work? mingw (and demos) and msvc 
now compile.

I put:
#ifndef NOMINMAX  
#define NOMINMAX 1   
#endif

at the top of Includes.hpp, is there a better place to put this?

Neil.

 >Hmm any errors and what browser?
Whenever I click 'edit this page' (after logging in), on arrival to the 
edit page, I'm logged out. I use Firefox, but I've tried IE and Opera

What Esa is saying is berlios is sometimes slow, sometimes fast. Right 
now, it's really really slow. If you want it consistently fast you can 
use the unofficial place. Just ftp to retrospec.sgn.net and login using 
openlayer/espoo

As for templates, any with a sidebar with a minimalist look really to 
match the current,

the MonoBook is nice as it looks like wiki
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=cache&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatewake.com%2Fwiki%2F_media%2Fimages%3Amonobook_for_dokuwiki.png

Roundbox is nice if you change the blue
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=cache&media=http%3A%2F%2Fchrisarndt.de%2Fen%2Fsoftware%2Fdokuwiki%2Fsshot_roundbox_template-0.3b.jpg

Ach is as devwiki but with extra menus
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/_detail/wiki:tpl:tpl_ach_simple.png?id=wiki%3Atpl%3Atemplates&cache=cache

I would say out of the three, roundbox is the nicer if you change the 
blue and grey to white and a couple of shades of grey (or maybe 
white/grey/bluey-grey)

mackem. the email for this is neil at retrospec.sgn.net

I've finished the vc8 build, there were a dozen or so changes to quite a 
few files. But don't panic most are minor changes to get VC to compile. 
I'll make a VC7 build tomorrow, should compile a treat I think. The only 
problem is VC6 and it's support for STL, I may have to give up on this one.

The only thing I don't know, as it's a C99 update I think, and it's in 
the demo program with the ? operator in the assignment. Anyone know what 
it's doing as it's quite hard to search for ? in google ;)

Neil.

Neil,

Yer set up for SVN access.

With the ? operator, do you mean a statment like this, pulled from the 
gamedemo Demo.cpp?

drunkenMode ? "Press D to restore normal mode" : "Press D for Drunken Mode!"

That statement is the "conditional expression" operator.  It returns one 
of two values -

-if the expression before ? evaluates to true, it returns the left hand 
side of the :
-if the expression before ? evaluates to false, it returns the right 
hand size of the :

It looks cryptic, but is quite handy shorthand...

-Brady

No, I know about the tertiary statement, it is this:
ballYSpeed += ((float(mouseYMovement) <? 2.5) <? 0 );

Message-ID: <443C3406.4020807@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
VC6 doesn't support the STL very well, in fact it's pretty rubbish. 
However, there are a lot of people using it. I've found a way to get 
round it but is it going too for your Esa/others?

Basically, in Includes.hpp I've done this:
#if defined (_MSC_VER) && _MSC_VER<1300
#define STL_SIN ::sin
#define STL_COS ::cos
#define STL_ATAN2 ::atan2
#define STL_SQRT ::sqrt
#define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
#define max(X, Y)  ((X) > (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
#else
#define STL_SIN std::sin
#define STL_COS std::cos
#define STL_ATAN2 std::atan2
#define STL_SQRT std::sqrt
#define STL_MIN std::min
#define STL_MAX std::max
#endif

and, well, you know what the consequences are.

Supposing it is ok, VC6 compiles ok (after a few more minor 
adjustments), except the following. Anyone care to offer a solution for 
the below error, or perhaps will we/I end up chasing shadows for every 
new feature that'll break vc6? This is the error, in a few files:

Polygon.cpp(237) : error C2893: Failed to specialize function template 
'class ol::Collision __thiscall ol::Shape::LineStripCollision(const 
std_container1 &,const std_container2 &,const class ol::Placement 
&,const class ol::Placement &,bool,bool,bool) const'
        With the following template arguments:
        'class std::vector<class ol::Vec2D,class std::allocator<class 
ol::Vec2D> >'
        'class std::list<class ol::Vec2D,class std::allocator<class 
ol::Vec2D> >'

Well, according to my mate, it's a GCC specific thing that is now 
deprecated and translates to, he thinks, min(min(a, 2.5), 0) which means 
it always return 0 ?

Without having VC6 available, and also not having the time to attack the 
specific problem right now, it looks like it CAN be solved by explicitly 
defining that function for the appropriate template types?

My personal take is that all modern compilers handle the STL well enough 
to handle OL - we're not doing anything THAT complex, quite honestly. 
MinGW/GCC folks are completely fine with upgrading their compiler 
because it's very actively developed and free to do so.  Now that VC 
express 2005 is free... should this even be an issue?

I mean, VC 6 was released in '98 - EIGHT years ago.  That's only 4 years 
after the STL standard was approved, much less compilers/libraries 
became available.  NO compiler handled it well back then and workarounds 
had to be made...

At this point free compilers have handled the entirety of the stl for 4 
or 5 years and many commercial compilers for longer - is it too much to 
ask for a user of a modernly-programmed library use a somewhat modern 
compiler?

I guess I just don't understand the reason why VC6 people can't upgrade 
now that it's free to do so...

But when it comes down to the handful of examples you showed regarding 
std::math functions, couldn't those just be solved by using the fully 
qualified "std::min" and "std::max" in OpenLayer?

Or is that the problem?  That VC6, in addition to the namespace 
pollution, also doesn't HAVE the std:: versions?

I have NO idea - I've never seen that in any code, book, or webpage. 
GCC extension is quite likely.  I see it there in the code...  I suppose 
asking Esa is the best option - and since he's reading all this too, I'm 
sure he'll see the question  ;)

The problem is VC6 not having the correct definitions in the cmath file 
and it's inability to handle the STL properly, for example, one STL 
workaround for one problem is that std::xxx isn't enough, you have to 
have 'using namespace std' as well! my solution is the only way I can 
see it working.

Esa is using std:: everywhere as you should, but the problem is as above.

However, VC8 isn't really free, it runs out after a year and the VC8 
compiler has loads of problems still with the new C library. However, it 
might be 1998 technology but it is still a better IDE that devc++ and 
code::blocks put together, in that it has a proper context dropdown for 
functions/data types/classes/etc doesn't crash and generally works all 
day no problem. One other minor thing that it does and I hate with 
devc++ (especially with the way the openlayer headers are organised!) is 
you can right click on a #include and simply open the file.

Looking at the errors I'm getting (9 of them) they are all the same 
collision template.

But the question is more, would everyone feel comfortable using STL_MIN 
definition instead of std::min everywhere in code. If not, then simply 
drop support for VC6.

Sorry, took me a while.
I'll take a look at those templates later on today.
About moving over to your server do you happen to have an ssh account?
Setting up through ftp is a pain. Since I have to setup all the files locally 
and then hope that everything is ok when I upload it.
Is there no other options?

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] VC6 port :)
Message-ID: <44455230.8000605@retrospec.sgn.net>

Esa/anyone else,
After using STLPort I've fixed most of the problems with the VC6 
compiler, however vc6 simply won't budge with std::cos, etc. Given that 
all these trig functions are just wrappers for math.h (according to 
http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/580115#target), will it be ok if I 
change them to simply sin,cos, etc. I've tested it with vc7,8 and minGW 
and all seems fine.

There is one other problem, but I'm not at my laptop at the minute, it's 
to do with one of the method signatures, but I'll get back later on that.

Neil.

Well, as long as all those #include <math.h> are in the source files only I 
don't see a reason why not :)

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] Documentation wiki
Message-ID: <200604210434.13943.juvinious@gmail.com>

I am curious to know what we should do?
I agree that berlios is slow for hosting the wiki so I guess that's out of the 
picture.
Neil proposed to use his server, although ftp wouldn't be the best option for 
me. Unless Neil is willing to set it up himself?
So should I go ahead and remove the pages from berlios?

Hello,
Can someone with the latest SVN try out the collision demo, it doesn't 
seem to bounce off the top/bottom of the screen anymore!

Neil.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] FreeType2 and Glyph system
Message-ID: <200604240959.21998.juvinious@gmail.com>

As this was brought up before, just like to revist it with news. :)
I was discussing on #allegro with Birdee-oh (brady) and others about the 
possibility of just using FreeType2 directly and the difficulty of doing so.
We were referred by someone to check out this simple library that shows how 
easy it is to use freetype:
http://fudgefont.sf.net
The library simply loads TTF fonts into an Allegro type Font which is also 
useable by AllegroGL. However it doesn't provide kerning support.
Going through the documentation of FreeType2 I found that it with a little 
more work, kerning support and other features are easily adoptable.
Thus I propose we begin work to use FreeType directly so we can slowly 
deprecate the troublesome Glyph Keeper dependency.
Instead of adding more code to TextRenderer, we could create a new class Glyph 
or something akin to that and do everything with FreeType there.
We can also adopt it so that it retains the functionality of GlyphKeeper's 
interface, that way we don't have to break the api of TextRenderer, making it 
transparent to the end user. This will also allow us to expand the 
functionality of TextRender to do more or so the things proposed by Fladimir 
before on being able to manipulate Glyphs directly.
With that in place we can then simply use preprocessors to switch from using 
GlyphKeeper to the new Glyph handler when compiling the library for testing 
until it is stable enough to completely deprecate GlyphKeeper.
What do you think? 
:)

That's my thoughts exactly!

There are other promising font libraries alvailable for OpenGL, maybe they 
could be worth looking at, but having "native" Freetype support could be 
best. Of course I'd be graceful if someone (possibly Freetype-savvy) could 
help with that. It's hard to find time for everything...

Sounds good then. I'm not all that truetype savy, but I can figure out how to 
use the api well enough to get the ball rolling.
I'll set it up so that it'll work in the way I proposed. I'll keep you posted 
on the changes as I make them. :)
