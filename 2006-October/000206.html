&gt;<i> I just tried out the changes on windows mingw and it compiled just as

Thank you very much. Got the OL update yesterday. 


Two remarks. 

I think that OpenLayer would be a good candidate for a DLL. I would try to make it a DLL, if there's no specific reason to not do so? It might turn out too difficult, but I expect that it would be fine. The advantage might be that the application does not have to link all these libraries which are referenced in OL. 

About coding format. I have since a few years adopted the habit to write each statement into one separate line. The reason is simply that debuggers are line-oriented, and single stepping is so much easier then. The question would be, if you would mind to change the code layout, such that every statement gets its own line? 

The point is, if I would start to make changes to make OL a DLL, I would rather prefer to adhere to that convention. Generally, I would try to write and changes in such a way that they go seamless into existing code, but the one-statement-one-line-rule would be important to me. 

Anyway, doing this DLL stuff will take its time, so there's no hurry to have an ultra-fast decision here. I would like to hear your comments though.
