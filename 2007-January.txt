Subject: [Openlayer-developer]  fix for Bitmap::Load

Hi all, 

As already explained in 
http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/589556
I think that this Bitmap::Load function is not working correctly and has to be changed. I have that change working fine for some time now, and would ask to have a look on it and commit it to SVN. 

I found this during my efforts to make OpenLayer work with guichan, where this function is used and made problems. 

The developer team of guichan is about to put the OpenLayer back end into their library and CVS, so in future they will officially support OpenLayer with their library.

Sounds good, I'll make the change and commit.
On another note, I'm going to be exporting the symbols in the library so that 
it can be possible to turn openlayer into a dll. So hopefully I'll have that 
done by sometime next week. :)

Ok so I went about the task of exporting the symbols in OpenLayer. I tested it 
on windows and was able to create a DLL of the library with success and was 
able to link the demos with it. Any of the windows users that have any 
interest in this I ask you to test it out yourself in your apps to make sure 
all required symbols are exported. I know some people were asking for this 
so, this is a good step in that general direction. In order to accomplish 
this I added two new preprocessors:
OL_SHARED and OL_LIB_BUILD
It should be fairly straightforward, when building the library pass 
both -DOL_SHARED and -DOL_LIB_BUILD. When linking against the library only 
pass -DOL_SHARED, however you might just want to throw #define OL_SHARED into 
the OpenLayer.hpp that way it's transparent.
Additionally I also merged loadpng into the library as it is small and 
required if OL_NO_PNG is not defined. Of course it won't be included if 
OL_NO_PNG is enabled so there is no need to worry about it. Just make sure 
you aren't linking with -lloadpng or -lldpng anymore in your link line. If 
you are on linux nothing changes as `openlayer-config --libs` produces the 
proper link line for you. :)
So regarding the dll stuff if you do happen to run across problems with it, 
missing symbols and what not, please post them here so I can correct them.
Thanks.

Excellent news, that's exactly what's missing from OL!

However, when I (temporarily) added #define OL_LIB_BUILD and #define 
OL_SHARED to OpenLayer.hpp and used the build system, I got:

Hmm it appears like you don't have libpng or it can't find it in your path. 
Basically all it is png.h and libpng.a or libpng12.a ... 
like c:\mingw\include\png.h and c:\mingw\lib\libpng.a.
Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to update the cbuild script to be able to 
create the dll for you, however I did do so with cmake. 
Regarding the new preprocessors you should only pass them in the command line 
not in the header. Once it's built you can place #define OL_SHARED in there.
If you want to test it out you can either do build it manually or I'd 
recommend you grab www.cmake.org 
(http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.4/cmake-2.4.6-win32-x86.exe) and install it.
Then in a cmd window in the directory in which you the source do:
mkdir temp
cd temp
cmakesetup ../
From there you'll get a setup window, choose MinGW or MSYS makefiles 
(depending on how your environment is setup) and then hit configure. You 
might want to fix anything that appears in red and set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX 
to where you want openlayer to install to, ie c:\mingw. If everything is fine 
you should be able to just hit ok which then it'll have generated makefiles 
and drop you back to the cmd line. All you have to do then is 'make' and 
then 'make install'.

Hope this helps. :)

Hi, 

I have just (accidentally) discovered that OpenLayer is licensed under LGPL - at least that is what the official site at berlios says. 

There's a problem here. 

With LGPL, if you include the files into your project, even by using a static library, your own project becomes infected with the LGPL, thus forces to release your own sourcecode under LGPL. The only way out would be to build a DLL, so that the binary can be used. 

I'm not sure if that is what you intended, and would ask you to check this issue. Maybe change the license to one that is less restrictive (the allegrogl project gives you the choice to use GPL or zlib, whatever you like better). I really would like to use OpenLayer for my own project, but I would not be able to use it with LGPL... 

Thanks!

Yeah, it originally used GZip license, but I thought LGPL would be the same. 
At least I'll give you a special permission to use it the way you like, 
until I've managed to change the license in Berlios' site...

Well it really depends on the restrictions you want to impose on the end user? 
If you want a generic or near to the public domain license, I'd look into png 
or zlib licenses. 
LGPL, however has an advantage over GPL in that you can link against the 
library and not have to LGPL your own code. However in tobings case I think 
he includes all the source to every library in his projects, which is what 
would cause his code to be infected. I didn't even know, honestly, that it 
was licensed under LGPL, there is no mention of the LGPL license in the 
openlayer sources. You should throw in a LICENSE file in the root directory, 
that way there are no confusions or misunderstandings.

Well, I just build the libraries all myself, mainly for debugging into any of them, or applying a small fix when I encounter a bug.

Yes, please.

Thank you very much! 


Hmm, I have just re-read a german translation of the LGPL, and I'm a little worried now. It seems that I misunderstood the usage of 'binary', and I thought that it would mean that in order to not get infected you must use a 'binary' distribution, i.e. a DLL. Which seems not to be the case, the restriction means that you can link against a compiled binary file, which would include a static library as well. On the other hand, IF you make changes to the LGPLed code, you must provide those changes as source code. Which means that I wouldn't be able to make changes to OpenLayer and not share them (which is the intention of LGPL and GPL in the first place). 

After all, LGPL does make sense with that interpretation, doesn't it?

Yeah, it should have GZip lisence, but there's been some confusion and a 
wrong license has been entered in the website...

Instead of weighing up the pros and cons of each licence and the 
restrictions, why not think hard if a licence really needed for OL?

Take Allegro, that's as close as you can get to not actually having a 
licence, but having one, and is all you need if the source you are 
writing is for public consumption for free.

Seems like some modifications to make it work with MSVC has caused it to 
cease work in GCC. I'll take a look, thanks!

gzip license would be fine.

Without license, you can't use it. So you have to explicitely supply a license if you want people to be able to use it...
