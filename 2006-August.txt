Subject: [Openlayer-developer] FreeType support update
Message-ID: <200608141614.39199.juvinious@gmail.com>

I finally got my opengl back and thus nearly finished up all the internal 
freetype rendering support. All that is actually missing now is hinting, 
which I haven't looked into yet. Though it should be something easy to 
implement. I also removed the required 'developer' paramater when building 
openlayer to get the prompt for the internal font renderer as it is working 
just as well as GlyphKeeper I think.
Please when you have an opportunity give it a run and see how it works for you 
and provide some feedback if something is wrong or missing. 
I will also post a thread on a.cc to let users know about the new feature as 
well. Thanks. :D
