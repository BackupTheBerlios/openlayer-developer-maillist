I haven't seen or heard from brady in like ages. I think that apple has got 
him locked up somewhere. :o
He should be the one that really knows of the state of the GUI. Last I talked 
to him he said he'd work on it more once the library uses FreeType directly. 
Since then he's gone missing.
I really need to get my GUI back to a working state so that it can be used 
with openlayer, though I've put that aside to finish up the work with 
FreeType and another project. So many things so little time I guess.

Hello,
Sorry, I've been working away for the past few months and only get time 
to do occasional postings here and there. Anyway I'm back and am 
continuing porting OL to MSVC (well recompiling every now and again to 
see if a working version is there!).

I've compiled and everything (when I make my MSVC changes) seems to 
work, which is great. Just one question, I've not included glyph.cpp 
into the my project file as I assume this is just a work in progress and 
all text demos seem to work. Is this right, or should I be including 
glyph.cpp?

 From quick memory, half the demos need minor updates and about 6 header 
and 8 source code files need changes to work. I'm re-testing all changes 
I make onto dev-c++ so I assume all will be well. If not, there's always 
SVN ;)

Neil.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] fault in DrawOutline method
Message-ID: <448DED5E.3000307@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
The collision demo doesn't work when compiled with MSVC. The fault is in 
the class BoundingRectangle created in the file, specifically the 
drawoutline method, where I think the fault is, is at the bottom of the 
email. In reverse trace the fault is in the stl vector code, this is 
part of the ++ operator overload:

        _SCL_SECURE_VALIDATE_RANGE(_Myptr < ((_Myvec 
*)(this->_Mycont))->_Mylast);

It is called by the LineStripRender constructor, the line at fault is 
the last one and is this:
         lengthIter++;

The line that calls this is in the poly code:

void ol::Poly::
ExecDrawOutline() const {
   data.LineStripRender( 0, 0, outlineTexture, lineWidth, placement, true );
}

This is called in the DrawOutline method of polygon.hpp at this line:
      ExecDrawOutline();

Finally, this is caused by the collision demo at the following line:
      Canvas::Refresh();


Tracing further, the faulty line is:
        goal.DrawOutline( Rgba::RED );

If I ignore the draw outline line, all is well and if I change the 
BoundingRectangle to a Rect (removing the .Contains method) it works as 
well.

If I change the code to simply Draw then all is well, so I guess the 
fault is with the outline bit. I tried explicitly calling         
goal.SetLineWidth(5.0) but that did nothing either.

Any help would be appreciated as this is the only fault now. If I get no 
reply I'll post to Allegro :)

Neil.

Glyph.{cpp/hpp} are a WIP and won't be ready for use just yet. If you've read 
my previous posts you would see where it stands.
When it's completed though, the glyph class will replace the Glyph Keeper 
requirement as it will use freetype directly.
Another note, even if you include the files with your project it won't compile 
nothing unless you set USE_NEW_TTF. And if you do set that env variable
all the source will compile soundly even text renderer you just won't get no 
textout support.  

What kind of changes are you making so that it compiles with msvc? If you are 
not breaking anything with the gcc compile I'd like to test it out on other 
platforms that way we can see if we can get these changes into svn. It seems 
redundant that you have to make changes everytime just to make a msvc compile 
work.

Ah, sorry I've been really busy with everything lately :P Well, it's such a 
simple thing to do actually, but I want to find a way to do it without 
having to copy-paste too much... Copy-pasting is never a solution...

So the demo crashes when you run it? I just wish MSVC would work a little 
better... I wonder how any professional coders can stand its issues... 
Sorry, but I can't help you much as I know nothing of MSVC : /

I'm not making changes everytime, I'm reapplying my changes to new 
builds in the hope that it compiles, so don't worry there is little work 
on my behalf. As for the changes, they are quite minor and really just 
make it more robust and platform neutral. I test everything on gcc as 
well, btw.

Changes include stuff like:
- declaring NOMINMAX as MSVC doesn't do this, but gcc does
- renaming loop variables so no duplicate warning messages (and errors 
in VC6) appear
- removing the gcc specific code (like the breakout demo)
- altering pragmas to work (e.g. the prettify pragma for the debug in 
the code is for gcc only)

etc.

Neil.

Altering the envelope slightly, I would say the VC8 compiler is far far 
superior to the gnu equivalent and more than likely the VC8 code is 
highlighting problems in the code that the gcc output isn't (remember 
the bug in the linestrip that worked ok in gcc, but there was a code 
fault in the end?). The STL from Microsoft is pretty much perfect as well.

Is there no way you can get VC8 running? it is free after all.

is there a function in openlayer yet to easily center text?  i have been
trying to develop my own but it seems it chokes on nonevenly spaced font
sets. i.e. Neuropol.  I'm just using the textreneder for rendering text so
far.

Yeah, TextRenderer has an overloaded Print-function, which takes the maxium 
line width in pixels (for automatic line wrap) and the text alignment (LEFT, 
CENTER, RIGHT or JUSTIFIED). Though I can't remember if it was CENTER or 
CENTERED and I can't check it right now from where I am...
