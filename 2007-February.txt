Message-ID: <45C1AABD.60709@retrospec.sgn.net>

Hello,
Following a thread at allegro.cc about min/max not working properly with 
gcc/msvc I posted this but I don't know if the latest svn fixes all the 
std::min/min and std::max/max problems so this may be irrelevant. 
Anyway, the fix I found to allow the same std::min and std::max to work 
with msvc is to add the preprocessor directive NOMINMAX, this basically 
tells msvc not to be so stupid.

I defined mine at the top of the internals.hpp and all worked when I 
compiled both mingw and msvc.

Neil.

That's interesting, I assume you have the current SVN revision? I'm using MSVC 7.1, and it compiles and works fine as it is in the depot. Well, except this new member function of class Line of course. Haven't tried the latest fixes by Fladimir yet...

but didn't I read somewhere that the fix now works with msvc because 
std:: was dropped from the min/max functions, but now it doesn't work 
with gcc/mingw?

if so, then nominmax is the permanent solution I guess.

Right, the fix made for that was to introduce 

#ifdef max
#undef max
#endif

#ifdef min
#undef min
#endif

in those headers that didn't compile. Was OlRectangle.hpp and Circle.hpp. 

I have tried to remove those undefs and use NOMINMAX instead, but it didn't work. It seems that there are several places where the MS headers define min and max, and only windef.h has this NOMINMAX thing around the define. In minmax.h there's no blocking, and the template implementations in xutility don't look at NOMINMAX either. 

So it depends on where exactly the NOMINMAX is placed (did not work in Internal.hpp for me) and how the windows header files are nested. 

So I suggest to leave it as it is... the current SVN revision does compile with gcc, doesn't it?

Hi there,

I would like to request a feature, namely a return value for 
Bitmap::Save (at least boolean). For my current application, I'm saving 
a bitmap to file, and I need to know whether the operation was 
successfully performed or not.

Yours,
   David.

That's a good idea indeed, by the way, for what do you use the image saving?

Simple fix, the GLDriver actually does return true or false, just never 
extended into Bitmap. :)
It's been updated.

Fladimir, is it possible you can give me access to the mailinglist so I can 
check the settings? I believe there are some issues with it concerning people 
trying to post to the list, like tobing.

Well, it wasn't me who made the mailing list in the first place... I can't 
remember anymore who of us it was, though.

Bradeeoh (Brady Eidson), he just upped and dissapeared. :|
Unless you are still in contact with him?
You should have access to give others access to maintaining certain aspects of 
the project afaik.

Wow, that was fast. Thank you! Oh, and because it was asked previously, 
we need it to save a pre-calculated lightmap in our game's editor. 
Nothing fancy :)

Yours,
   David.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] Safety of ol::Setup::SetupProgram()
Message-ID: <45E59D18.1020301@gmx.net>

Hello fellas,

during the usual development work on our current game, I came across an 
issue in OpenLayer that I think should be part of the library, not my 
code. The thing is, I need to have Allegro initialized before I set up 
OpenLayer (this is due to the "runlevel"-ish layout of our homebrewn 
engine). ol::Setup::SetupProgram() has some really nasty effects, if 
allegro_init() had been called prior to invoking this method (there are 
two windows, the keyboard doesn't work properly, ...)

I made the change by manually calling allegro_exit() before 
ol::Setup::SetupProgram(), and it appears to work. I'm not entirely 
convinced about the safety of this measure (i.e., what happens if 
allegro_exit() is called but Allegro had not been initialized), so take 
it with a grain of salt.

I don't have the time right now to dig deeper into this stuff (deadlines 
:X), I just thought of giving you a pointer that 
ol::Setup::SetupProgram() doesn't like a pre-initialized Allegro.

Yours,
   David.

I had the same, but do you need allegro completely initialized or only parts? You could call 

install_allegro( SYSTEM_NONE, &errno, atexit );

and use the config routines and many others, but not have a window opened. 
At least for me that was sufficient...
