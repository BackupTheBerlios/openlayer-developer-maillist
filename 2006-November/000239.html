</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hm, no idea what's going wrong there. Unfortunately I can't easily try it

</I>

&gt;<i>Ah, did you build every library you use with MSVC 8 or did you include
</I>&gt;<i> already compiled &gt;and linked libraries into your link step? Just a guess,
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe the object files are not &gt;easily compatible?
</I>

Ok it seems it's not my environment I had to tweak the configuration to make
it  produce a lib. Now it links the library fine, but when trying to compile
the demos I'm back to the same spot with the C1900 errors. Frustrating, but
I'll figure it out.

&gt;<i> Did you use the cmake to generate the project files for 7.1, to test it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I did now, but it didn't work. So first, I had a hard time to configure
</I>&gt;<i> everything so that it &gt;seemed reasonable. Then I pressed OK, and cmake took
</I>&gt;<i> quite a time to generate files, do &gt;some compilations etc, I can't say
</I>&gt;<i> because cmake doesn't give any feedback about what &gt;it's doing.
</I>

Yeah when it's creating the project files it sucks. It should at least tell
you or give some indication.

&gt;<i>Eventually it finished and had created a solution and a bunch of project
</I>&gt;<i> files - but didn't &gt;compile. There are assumptions left about the
</I>&gt;<i> environment: First, I don't have the paths to &gt;my MSVC directories in my
</I>&gt;<i> environment, just to avoid any confusion between different &gt;installed
</I>&gt;<i> versions of MSVC on the same PC (have 6.0, 7.0 and 7.1 here).
</I>

&gt;<i>Then it assumes that the allegro directory is in the include path, which it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't for the same &gt;reason actually, because I'm building many different
</I>&gt;<i> projects with the different studio &gt;versions, so I can't put anything into
</I>&gt;<i> the standard include path (same for lib path). I guess &gt;this could also be
</I>&gt;<i> configured with cmake, making the configuration process even longer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Overall I like that most everything is configurable with cmake, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see yet why it &gt;should be easier that way than having a solution and project
</I>&gt;<i> files, which could be adopted &gt;to one's environment - well it may be easier
</I>&gt;<i> for the deployment of the library.
</I>

Yes I'm totally aware of this and I'm working on including compensation for
those with separated installs and directories so that it's totally
configurable by the user. This will not however make it longer, it's just
long because it takes time for it to generate the project files. When it
creates unix/msys makefiles it takes but a few seconds.
The issue with not having static project files is that each environment is
not going to be the same.  Having cmake generate these files configured to
your environment is much more sound and increases the odds of deploying the
library to any environment.

&gt;<i>Why does cmake copy 'Openlayer.hpp' into it's build directory?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Well, I have compared that file with the original file, but I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> bad style to change the &gt;original file to put additional defines into that
</I>&gt;<i> header file, or change anything else...
</I>

The original header doesn't compensate for the preprocessors that are passed
during compilation. You have to add these yourself and/or pass them whenever
you want to link against the lib. I've never heard of this as being bad
style, allegro does this as well as tons of other libraries. If you look at
the build directory you'll see there is an OpenLayer.hpp.in look at the
#cmakedefine macros and you'll see why.

Overall it's coming along, just give me some time to get the kinks out of
it.
