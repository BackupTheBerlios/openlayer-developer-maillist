<PRE>Yesterday I wrote up a cmake script for creating build files on different 
platforms and environments. So far it can generate makefiles for mingw, msys 
and *nix based platforms as well as MSVC vcproj files. On *nix based 
platforms it's capable of creating the lib statically or shared. On mingw and 
msys it can as well, shared being that it generates a dll. However since 
nothing is exposed in the lib by means of __dllspec(export) the lib is 
useless in that form. I recall somebody bringing up the idea that they would 
like to see it as a dll. Now with the possibility of creating it as a dll, 
what should be exposed? We can probably add in a simple preprocessor like:
#ifdef DLL_BUILD
#define DLL_FUNC __dllspec(export)
#else
#define DLL_FUNC __dllspec(import)
#endif
and prepend the functions of the library that should be exposed.
Any ideas?

Now for the MSVC related stuff. I wasn't able to get the project files to 
build since I keep getting an error C1900 
(<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ks07be9f.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ks07be9f.aspx</A>)
which has to do with my msvc installation.
If the environment is setup properly and all the requisite libs are installed, 
I believe that the compilation should work. In the end it should generate the 
proper openlayer.lib and accompanying files as well as build the examples.
If anybody has msvc and is willing to install cmake to give it a go, I'd be 
gratefull. Oh and the names of the libraries I have it set to looks like 
this:
alleg.lib - allegro
agl.lib - allegrogl
libpng.lib - libpng
ldpng.lib - loadpng
freetype.lib - freetype2
zlib.lib - zlib
glyph-agl.lib - glyphkeeper (if you are not using the internal render)
gdi32.lib - windows stuff ?
glu32.lib - opengl related?
opengl32.lib - opengl

If I'm missing any other libs I should be linking against please let me know 
and I'll add them in.

And if you don't know what cmake is take a look: <A HREF="http://www.cmake.org">http://www.cmake.org</A>
I believe this is the direction where the build system should be going. Since 
it can provide us the means of allowing OpenLayer to be used in other 
environments and not limited to gcc.
And although cbuild works great, it still has the tendency to fail on some 
environments, allowing cmake to be the better alternative. Also, many FOSS 
projects (<A HREF="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Projects">http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Projects</A>) are going in that 
direction as well, KDE being the top one.

If you are on windows you can download the binary installer.
It's relatively simple and straightforward.
Here's a basic run down of how to get cmake to spit out the files.
On windows:
Create a temporary directory in the openlayer root directory. Change into it 
and run &quot;cmakesetup ../&quot;.
This will bring up a GUI for configuring it. Choose your environment (ie 
MinGW, MSVC, etc.) and go through the options fixing anything that shows red 
and then re-generate the configuration. Once you are done that hit ok. If you 
are creating vcproj files you're going to have to be patient as that takes 
some time, it'll seem like the app is hanging, just wait it out. Once it's 
done if you did makefiles for msys/mingw then just run make. If you created 
vcproj files open the OpenLayer.sln solution file with msvc and build it.

If any of you have experience working with cmake any help improving the script 
would be appreciated. If not your feedback will be just as appreciated.

Thanks. :)
