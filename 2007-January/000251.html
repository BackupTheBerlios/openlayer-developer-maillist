&gt;<i> Well it really depends on the restrictions you want to impose on the end
</I>&gt;<i> user? 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want a generic or near to the public domain license, I'd look into
</I>&gt;<i> png or zlib licenses. 
</I>&gt;<i> LGPL, however has an advantage over GPL in that you can link against the 
</I>&gt;<i> library and not have to LGPL your own code. 
</I>&gt;<i> However in tobings case I think he includes all the source to every 
</I>&gt;<i> library in his projects, which is what would cause his code to be 
</I>&gt;<i> infected. 
</I>
Well, I just build the libraries all myself, mainly for debugging into any of them, or applying a small fix when I encounter a bug. 


&gt;<i> I didn't even know, honestly, that it was licensed under LGPL, there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no mention of the LGPL license in the openlayer sources. You should 
</I>&gt;<i> throw in a LICENSE file in the root directory, that way there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> confusions or misunderstandings.
</I>
Yes, please. 



&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, it originally used GZip license, but I thought LGPL would be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same. At least I'll give you a special permission to use it the way you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like, until I've managed to change the license in Berlios' site...
</I>
Thank you very much! 


Hmm, I have just re-read a german translation of the LGPL, and I'm a little worried now. It seems that I misunderstood the usage of 'binary', and I thought that it would mean that in order to not get infected you must use a 'binary' distribution, i.e. a DLL. Which seems not to be the case, the restriction means that you can link against a compiled binary file, which would include a static library as well. On the other hand, IF you make changes to the LGPLed code, you must provide those changes as source code. Which means that I wouldn't be able to make changes to OpenLayer and not share them (which is the intention of LGPL and GPL in the first place). 

After all, LGPL does make sense with that interpretation, doesn't it?
