<PRE>Ok so I went about the task of exporting the symbols in OpenLayer. I tested it 
on windows and was able to create a DLL of the library with success and was 
able to link the demos with it. Any of the windows users that have any 
interest in this I ask you to test it out yourself in your apps to make sure 
all required symbols are exported. I know some people were asking for this 
so, this is a good step in that general direction. In order to accomplish 
this I added two new preprocessors:
OL_SHARED and OL_LIB_BUILD
It should be fairly straightforward, when building the library pass 
both -DOL_SHARED and -DOL_LIB_BUILD. When linking against the library only 
pass -DOL_SHARED, however you might just want to throw #define OL_SHARED into 
the OpenLayer.hpp that way it's transparent.
Additionally I also merged loadpng into the library as it is small and 
required if OL_NO_PNG is not defined. Of course it won't be included if 
OL_NO_PNG is enabled so there is no need to worry about it. Just make sure 
you aren't linking with -lloadpng or -lldpng anymore in your link line. If 
you are on linux nothing changes as `openlayer-config --libs` produces the 
proper link line for you. :)
So regarding the dll stuff if you do happen to run across problems with it, 
missing symbols and what not, please post them here so I can correct them.
Thanks.
