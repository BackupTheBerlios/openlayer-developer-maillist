<PRE>Instead of weighing up the pros and cons of each licence and the 
restrictions, why not think hard if a licence really needed for OL?

Take Allegro, that's as close as you can get to not actually having a 
licence, but having one, and is all you need if the source you are 
writing is for public consumption for free.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I have just re-read a german translation of the LGPL, and I'm a little worried now. It seems that I misunderstood the usage of 'binary', and I thought that it would mean that in order to not get infected you must use a 'binary' distribution, i.e. a DLL. Which seems not to be the case, the restriction means that you can link against a compiled binary file, which would include a static library as well. On the other hand, IF you make changes to the LGPLed code, you must provide those changes as source code. Which means that I wouldn't be able to make changes to OpenLayer and not share them (which is the intention of LGPL and GPL in the first place). 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After all, LGPL does make sense with that interpretation, doesn't it?
