<PRE>There's alot of interest for a &quot;standard&quot; OpenLayer GUI, and that I 
understand.
I also have alot of personal ideas for what would be great OpenLayer 
features.

Fladimir has a goal of keeping OpenLayer clean and focused on its 
minimalistic goal.  That, I understand as well.  Can't disagree with it 
one bit!

So I have a proposal - OpenLayer Addons.  Lemme explain

I started putting together a class structure for a GUI.  I'm putting it 
into the namespace ol::gui and it's file structure integrates in with 
the OpenLayer directory tree.

ie - I have
OpenLayer/Gui.hpp
as a master header for the gui, then I have
OpenLayer/Gui/Window.hpp
for the base Window class, for example.

But I am keeping it as a distinctly seperate project from OL and just 
add the Openlayer include path into my project for ol::gui

The idea is to either add an &quot;addons&quot; path to the openlayer SVN 
repository or, probably a better idea, to start an OpenLayer Addons 
project.

I keep the &quot;addons&quot; concept instead of calling it &quot;gui&quot; because one 
&quot;addons&quot; project could host multiple addon systems - ol::sprite as an 
example.

Any ol::[addon] would have a specific OpenLayer dependency and possibly 
depend on another ol::[addon], but they would all integrate cleanly into 
the OpenLayer file tree.  Lets say OpenLayer 2.1 is released.  We could 
then release ol::Gui 2.1 which unzips into the OpenLayer 2.1 file tree, 
puts a Makefile.gui in the main directory, and therefore is cleanly 
integrated in for users.

I love the idea of seperating all the add-on stuff from the core 
OpenLayer so development of OL doesn't rely on addons at all, but it 
gives a platform for us to explore the GUI addon stuff and other 
experimental things.  Ideas that work out will persist, and anything 
that doesn't can die off as it's own module.

Anyways, this is my vision.  Lemme know thoughts and comments!

-Brady
