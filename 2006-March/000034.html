<PRE>&gt;<i> Firstly, do you think that we need, for performance reasons, separate:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> bool Collides(...)
</I>&gt;<i> Collision GetCollision( ... )
</I>
Personally, I can see a few uses for bool Collides().  But, I also know 
that it's currently implemented by calling GetCollision() and returning 
collision.IsCollision()

Meaning that instead of being quicker than GetCollision, which it could 
be, it's actually a little slower.

&gt;<i> Or maybe just GetCollision would be enough? I've implemented them both for
</I>&gt;<i> the most time-consuming collisions, namely with Polys and LineStrips.
</I>
You've implemented both seperately, or &quot;Collides&quot; relies on GetCollision?
/me looks at the code
Yah, it's how I thought, but I think you have changes you just haven't 
committed because I don't have anything for LineStrip  ;)

So I guess my final opinion is - bool Collides() is useful and worth it 
IF it is actually done quicker than GetCollision(), but that may require 
restructuring how the functions are called and/or having two seperate 
collision methods for the two cases.

&gt;<i> Also, what do you suppose that the normal for a Point (when colliding)
</I>&gt;<i> should return? Vec2D( 0, 0 ) I guess?
</I>
A Point colliding with a Point should be Vec2D( 0, 0 ), if that's what 
you meant.  I can't think of any other good meaning...

&gt;<i> And finally, I think aiming for clean and readable code would be better 
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> aiming for absolutely best performance. So maybe when colliding rotated
</I>&gt;<i> Rects they should be converted to Polys first? What do you think?
</I>
I agree!
