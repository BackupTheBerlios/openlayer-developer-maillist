<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmmmmm  elaborate more on this.  Are you thinking like a basic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;spreadsheet&quot;-type control with cells that can have arbitrary contents 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and alignment?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't even thinking on such an abstract level, but now that I come to 
</I>&gt;<i> think of it, that would be probably even better, yes. I was thinking in 
</I>&gt;<i> terms of the Object Explorer in IDEs like Delphi, Visual Studio, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation of such control shouldn't be too difficult, as it is 
</I>&gt;<i> a panel with a grid layout manager and a bunch of labels (and possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> textboxes, or any other control for that matter). The most significant 
</I>&gt;<i> feature of this compound control would be methods for easily 
</I>&gt;<i> adding/modifying rows.
</I>
I'm not familiar with any commercial IDE - my entire programmer 
upbringing has been in text editors and FOSS ides that don't have such 
things.  ;)

So your ORIGINAL Idea was simply - if I'm getting this right - a two 
column control, perhaps with a heading, that has keys in the left column 
and values in the right column?  And the values editable?

&gt;<i> This leads me to another thing, namely what to do with oversize? Should 
</I>&gt;<i> we go the Java awt way and provide both a Panel and a ScrollPanel?
</I>
That, or just assume any panel can be scrollable but have the scrollbars 
hidden by default and you can force them on/off as needed


&gt;<i> Hm, I'll have to look into MASkinG first, because I don't know how it 
</I>&gt;<i> handles this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before any further discussion about the implementation details, we maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> should get the goals, features and restrictions straight, and build the 
</I>&gt;<i> system around that. To make a start:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Should the GUI support skins at all? (you can skip all further 
</I>&gt;<i> questions on answering this with 'no')
</I>
Yes

&gt;<i> - Should the creation of a custom skin be focused on ease, or on maximum 
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility?
</I>
Both  ;)  Sensible defaults (ease) with advanced usage possible

&gt;<i> - Should skins be changeable at runtime?
</I>
Hmmmm... I had always assumed &quot;yes&quot; but the possiblity of &quot;no&quot; is 
intriguing.  I'll have to think about this...

&gt;<i> - Should skins be mixable? (i.e. a few controls of skin A, a few of skin 
</I>&gt;<i> B, etc. - I think you get the idea)
</I>
Yes.  For example, your main menus/config screens could be one skin, but 
  a different set of dialogs in the game would be a different skin.  I 
think a global-apply is very useful, but selectively applying to 
different branches in the GUI hierarchy is useful as well!

&gt;<i> - Should a skin affect the looks, the feel, or both of them?
</I>
I tend to think any attempt to change the &quot;feel&quot; of a widget should 
involve a custom widget as we're already just providing clean, basic 
functionality.  I suppose SOME &quot;feel&quot; aspects could be configurable 
based on skin, but I can't think of any right now as my head is still 
foggy from being sick.

&gt;<i> These are a few questions that came to my mind, albeit I'm confident I 
</I>&gt;<i> missed a bunch, so feel free to add to the list ;-)
</I>
I'm sure you missed some, too, but I can't think of any now.  See 
previously mentioned comment regarding my foggy head.


If I'm awake long enough today, I may actually work a little on some 
headers and a design doc, but, we'll see.

I also want to track down a collision poly bug in OpenLayer core and fix 
that.  I think trying to do so may knock me unconscious.  :)

Peace
-Brady
