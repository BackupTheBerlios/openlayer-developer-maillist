<PRE> &gt; To clarify, ol::Poly::MoveBy( Vec2D ) is great but I think there 
should also be ol::Poly::MoveTo( Vec2D )


Having Shape::MoveTo would be useful indeed, but how can you know where 
the Shape should be moved? Should the top-left corner to be moved to the 
specified location? Or the center? That's why there's only MoveBy as 
it's unambiguous.

PS. And Poly should still be moved around mainly by using Transforms. 
But I'll change that in the future.

 &gt; For example if I create, say, a square...
 &gt;
 &gt; Poly p;
 &gt; p.Add( Vec2D( 0, 0 ));
 &gt; p.Add( Vec2D( 30, 0 ));
 &gt; p.Add( Vec2D( 30, 30 ));
 &gt; p.Add( Vec2D( 0, 30 ));
 &gt;
 &gt; I would love to use it as a generically relocatable square.  I can 
call p.MoveBy( ... ) to move it around the screen but sometimes you can 
only know an absolute location where you'd like to move it instead of a 
relative location.  If I've move it around the screen hundreds of times 
each by a fractional Vec2Ds, floating point math will have compounded 
flaws to the point that it's exact position in relation to the origin 
cannot be known.
 &gt;
 &gt; Even if I keep track of all of these MoveBy() calls and I try to do a 
MoveBy() to send it back to the origin, there's no guarantee it will 
actually end up back at (0.0,0.0).
 &gt;
 &gt; Theres a few complexities the arise by my proposal - how to keep 
track of initial position remains a problem.
 &gt;
 &gt; One idea I have would be to keep 2 copies of the vertices - an 
initial position and a current position.  They would start the same... 
but a call to MoveBy() would affect the current position and a call to 
MoveTo() would do its math on the initial position creating a new 
&quot;current position&quot;
 &gt;
 &gt; We could either take a small time penalty upon object initialization 
by storing two copies of each vertex, or we could do a copy-on-write by 
only making a &quot;current position&quot; vector upon the first call to MoveBy() 
or MoveTo()
 &gt;
 &gt; The size penalty is obvious but also depends on the number of 
vertices in the poly.
 &gt;
 &gt; What do you think?  If there's no objections I've basically already 
implemented my method - though I could add copy-on-write to it.  Or, any 
other ideas on how we could acheive the same thing differently?
 &gt;
 &gt; Peace,
 &gt; -Brady
