<PRE>I commited changed to initially add MoveTo() to all shapes except 
LineStrip and Poly.

For Ellipse, Circle, Rect, and Point the entire &quot;position&quot; concept makes 
perfect sense and is great as implemented.

For Line it still makes sense, but since Line::start and Line::end are 
public that adds the possibility that the user can change the two points 
to their liking, it'll work, but then their next call to MoveTo() or 
MoveBy() will refer to the initial coordinates again.

That kind of brings up a strong case for privatizing those points and 
make them changable through accessors instead.

I stopped short of changing LineStrip and Poly because of the semantic 
questions it raises.

Such as, what if some adds a handful of vertices to a Poly, calls 
MoveTo() or MoveBy(), then adds another vertex?  Should that vertex 
refer to the initial positions or to the current position (which is what 
it would do now)?

Who knows, we can talk bout that.

If MoveTo() is decided against, well, we revert to revision 16 of the 
repository  :)

Peace
