<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes, you got it right, that was my original idea. I attached a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>screenshot (PNG-8), taken from Borland's Delphi 6 IDE, which should make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things more clear. Please ignore the possibility of hierarchies in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>screenshot, I wasn't even remotely thinking about supporting that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Other than that, I'll have a closer look at MASkinG, and wait for your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>next header/design doc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yours,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  David.

</I>&gt;<i> Hmm that kind of widget is complex, not really a necessity, as far as I see 
</I>&gt;<i> it, in a core GUI lib. If anything that can be implemented by the end 
</I>&gt;<i> developer. From my point of view at looking at what a GUI for games requires 
</I>&gt;<i> is that they need to be as simplified as possible, easy to implement and 
</I>&gt;<i> contain very basic widgets of which to build off of. Too much excess and I 
</I>&gt;<i> think the GUI has gone overboard. A simple framework is what anybody is 
</I>&gt;<i> looking for most of the time. Something I hope to achieve with my own GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> Though this brainstorming is good and definitely a step in the right direction 
</I>&gt;<i> for implementing a GUI add-on to OpenLayer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I also tend to think that widget would be a tad complex for our core AIM 
here.  It seems to me it can be implemented with a Panel, pairs of 
Labels and Textboxes, and a GridSizer.

Not that it wouldn't be nice to have!  I just think it can be filed 
under the category of &quot;compound widget that would be nice to have later 
on&quot;  ;)

I think I'll have alot more concrete ideas down on paper today to show 
y'all.

juvinious - We've been exchanging for a few days on the basic layout 
I've submitted without input from you.  Anything you wanna chime in?  I 
know you have SAGGUI going on and I'm looking at it as a reference along 
with all the other options out there.  I don't want you to feel like I'm 
ignoring the work you presented to me  ;)

-Brady
