<PRE>Hello,
Neil here, first time poster. And hopefully this is the right mailing 
list to subscribe to, I've tried for a few days to subscribe but never 
received a mailman email.

I've been compiling build 20060318 on VC8, VC6 and minGW and this time 
I've managed to note down the problems. Some of which might be fixed in 
later releases or maybe picked up from my post at allegro.cc.

1.  __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ is gcc only. vc can use __FUNCDNAME__ or 
__FUNCTION__ (the DNAME being the pretty one). I only tested this on VC8 
though.

2. Not an error as such, but an annoying warning that fills the scree 
up. Even in VC8, the compiler grumbles badly about using the same named 
variable in inner and outer blocks in the same function. All are in the 
Bitmap.cpp file (around line 1129). Fixing (which is what I did) is as 
simple as changing y to y2 in the 'for(int y=0;' statement. The VC 
warning given is:
nonstandard extension used : 'y' : loop control variable declared in the 
for-loop is used outside the for-loop scope; it conflicts with the 
declaration in the outer scope

3. I don't know if it's a bad ordering of header files or not, but no 
version of VS can compile the files that uses std::min and std::max. 
Every build I have to change it to just min/max.

4. Shapedemo. The bitmaps are missing.

5. Shapedemo.Not an error, but END_OF_FUNCTION() should have the 
function name in the ()

6. VC doesn't support the use of ? in 'ballYSpeed += 
((float(mouseYMovement) &lt;? 2.5) &lt;? 0 );' in it's compiler. I have to 
redo this code every time.

7. in Rect::SetAccuracy( float accuracy ), there's the possibility of a 
divide by zero.

8. in debug mode, VC crashes very badly at the following line in the 
garbage collector, haven't a clue why, though, the error is in xutility
   OlLog( std::string( &quot;\nAuto Loader: Executing &quot; ) + ToString( 
pendings.size() ) + &quot; pending loading commands&quot; );

finally, while all the above are easily fixed, there is a fault in 
LineStrip that means I can't release a VC build, and there are lots of 
people asking me for a VC binary build at my website of the latest SVN 
so if anyone has a fix, it'll be welcomed. Heaven knows why it works 
with minGW. From an allegro posting, Flad knows of it. Anyway, in 
linstrip render method,

  // Add a vertex to the beginning of the line strip //
   inline void AddToBegin( Vec2D vertex ) {
      if( vertices.size() &gt; 1 ) {
         float length = ( vertices.front() - vertex ).GetMagnitude();
         lengths.push_front( length );
         totalLength += length;
      }

      vertices.push_front( vertex );
   }

Crashes the linstrip demo. What's happening is the code:

            sumLengths += *lengthIter;

is being called even though lengths has not entries, due to vertices size not being &gt;1

Apologies, I can only list the faults as I don't have any SVN clients and don't really have that much time,
but hopefully someone is not as lazy as me and implements the changes ;)


Neil.
