<PRE>&gt;<i>1.  __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ is gcc only. vc can use __FUNCDNAME__ or 
</I>&gt;<i>__FUNCTION__ (the DNAME being the pretty one). I only tested this on VC8 
</I>&gt;<i>though.
</I>
Yeah, that'll be changed.

&gt;<i>All are in the Bitmap.cpp file (around line 1129). Fixing (which is what I 
</I>&gt;<i>did) is as simple as changing y to y2 in the 'for(int y=0;' statement. The 
</I>&gt;<i>VC warning given is:
</I>&gt;<i>nonstandard extension used : 'y' : loop control variable declared in the 
</I>&gt;<i>for-loop is used outside the for-loop scope; it conflicts with the 
</I>&gt;<i>declaration in the outer scope
</I>
OK, I first thought I could set up MSVC 8 before trying to find where I've 
re-used the loop variables. But I never got that to work... :/

&gt;<i>3. I don't know if it's a bad ordering of header files or not, but no 
</I>&gt;<i>version of VS can compile the files that uses std::min and std::max. Every 
</I>&gt;<i>build I have to change it to just min/max.
</I>
Yeah, maybe some MSVC specific definitions have to be made

&gt;<i>4. Shapedemo. The bitmaps are missing.
</I>
They're now in the SNV.

&gt;<i>6. VC doesn't support the use of ? in 'ballYSpeed += 
</I>&gt;<i>((float(mouseYMovement) &lt;? 2.5) &lt;? 0 );' in it's compiler. I have to redo 
</I>&gt;<i>this code every time.
</I>
Yeah, that's been there for ages. I even though that I had corrected it but 
seems like it's still there :P

&gt;<i>7. in Rect::SetAccuracy( float accuracy ), there's the possibility of a 
</I>&gt;<i>divide by zero.
</I>
Well, I know that but SetAccuracy (as in Circle::SetAccuracy and 
Settings::SetCircleAccuracy) specify that the accuracy must be positive (not 
zero). Maybe a test is in order, anyways. It's not OpenLayer's style to 
crash if the parameter rules aren't followed ;)

&gt;<i>8. in debug mode, VC crashes very badly at the following line in the 
</I>&gt;<i>garbage collector, haven't a clue why, though, the error is in xutility
</I>&gt;<i>   OlLog( std::string( &quot;\nAuto Loader: Executing &quot; ) + ToString( 
</I>&gt;<i>pendings.size() ) + &quot; pending loading commands&quot; );
</I>
That's with 2.0+? I thought I corrected that by making the auto loader to be 
intialized lazily. Maybe there's still some initializations which aren't 
lazy yet.

&gt;<i>finally, while all the above are easily fixed, there is a fault in 
</I>&gt;<i>LineStrip that means I can't release a VC build
</I>
Yeah, I know that. But there's the following in the beginnin of 
LineStrip::Render:

  if( GetNumOfVertices() &lt; 2 ) {
      return;
   }

So if the number of vertices is one the LineStrip shouldn't be rendered. Can 
you see the exact point of the crash in the debugger?
