<PRE>Well I mentioned in that thread that I had been working on one for some time 
now. My ideas are simply based on the experiences having from using other 
peoples GUI's and windowing systems. Either they are overtly complex or lack 
the desired items needed for a game IMO.
Although I said I have been working on it, it still is a WIP, probably would 
be like that for some time and more than likely probably doesn't meet your 
criteria. :P 
Although to start it would be nice to see OpenLayer's animation class to 
include more functionality or to include some form of management system for 
the animations. (which was being discussed in irc by you and several others).
With that you can then extend that functionality into your own GUI to cover 
the animations you so desire in your widgets.
Although out of curiosity, how extensive do you need the animations in your 
widgets? For the most part most of the things that I would see or can think 
of animated are within a widget, which can easily be a canvas/bitmap that is 
consistently updated like a map. Icons could be animated as well doing that. 
Maybe I'm not seeing it the way you are thinking, maybe you can elaborate 
some more on that?
If anything at all to keep it simple, openlayer can probably just include a 
simple framework of gui elements that can be extended by the end developer 
according to his needs in his own projects. ie:
//Basic classes in OL
guiWidget
guiInput
guiMouse
dialog : guiWidget : guiInput : guiMouse

//End developers widgets
myTextBox : dialog
myInputBox : dialog
myMap : guiWidget
etc etc.

Who knows though even that gets complex. :P
But I think it would be much cleaner than say Allegro's GUI, which is horrible 
IMO, especially since it OL is c++ and begs for things to be more OO 
oriented.
