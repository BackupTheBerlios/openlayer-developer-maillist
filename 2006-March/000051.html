Hmm that kind of widget is complex, not really a necessity, as far as I see 
it, in a core GUI lib. If anything that can be implemented by the end 
developer. From my point of view at looking at what a GUI for games requires 
is that they need to be as simplified as possible, easy to implement and 
contain very basic widgets of which to build off of. Too much excess and I 
think the GUI has gone overboard. A simple framework is what anybody is 
looking for most of the time. Something I hope to achieve with my own GUI.
Though this brainstorming is good and definitely a step in the right direction 
for implementing a GUI add-on to OpenLayer.
