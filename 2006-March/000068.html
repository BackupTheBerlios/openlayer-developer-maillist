<PRE>I think some of the other stuff Juvinious was fixing/planning on fixing, 
like maybe he mentioned PRETTYFUNCTION, or maybe I'm confusing him with 
someone else.

MSVC complaing about the same-named variables is a PITA considering it's 
completely, 100% valid C++ code and MS should just butt out of our 
business  ;)

Anyways, glad you're back Esa.
The Gui got a good start but I haven't worked on it in about 2 weeks as 
I've gotten busy with tons of other stuff all of the sudden.  With any 
luck I can get back to it in the next week.

Having XML skins was always my plan, but XML for the widgets...  well, 
no reason it can't be done but I'm not going to worry about it for some 
time...  ;)

PS:  Neil - I emailed you directly about adding you to the list, didn't 
you get that email?  I dunno why berlios never sent you the response but 
it sounds almost like you have an overzealous spam filter or something  :)
