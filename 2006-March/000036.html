<PRE>Hi gang,

in an attempt to decrease compilation times, I would like to have a 
&quot;forward&quot; version of OpenLayer.hpp that has all the OpenLayer stuff as 
forward declarations. The original intent is to use that file (I call it 
OpenLayerFwd.hpp) in a header file (where no full type specifications 
are needed), and have it all defined in the corresponding translation 
unit (where it is to include OpenLayer.hpp as usual).

This will not expose the full OpenLayer class definitions to the outside 
and should help reduce compilation times.

I can see no downside for that effect, because it doesn't break existing 
code. Also, it shouldn't be difficult to maintain. What do you think 
about it?

Yours,
  David.

P.S.: If you're too busy creating that file, I could do that - I don't 
have repository access, so somebody else would still have to commit it.

P.P.S.: If there's already a file for that matter, please forgive me. I 
looked in the source-tree and didn't find anything, which means that I 
might not have looked well enough.

</PRE>
