<PRE>Thank you for your elaborated answer. I will take the freedom to remove 
parts of your original post, and reply only to the rest (naturally).

That should do the trick ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) I'm also kind-of missing a control for tabular output of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name&lt;-&gt;value tuples. This might be useful especially for tool 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development (all kind of editors etc.), and probably also for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debugging purposes in-game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmmmm  elaborate more on this.  Are you thinking like a basic 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spreadsheet&quot;-type control with cells that can have arbitrary contents 
</I>&gt;<i> and alignment?
</I>
I wasn't even thinking on such an abstract level, but now that I come to 
think of it, that would be probably even better, yes. I was thinking in 
terms of the Object Explorer in IDEs like Delphi, Visual Studio, etc.
The implementation of such control shouldn't be too difficult, as it is 
a panel with a grid layout manager and a bunch of labels (and possibly 
textboxes, or any other control for that matter). The most significant 
feature of this compound control would be methods for easily 
adding/modifying rows.

This leads me to another thing, namely what to do with oversize? Should 
we go the Java awt way and provide both a Panel and a ScrollPanel?

&gt;&gt;<i> 4) class Console. I think this goes beyond the scope of the GUI. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already have my own console implemented, so I don't mind, but I think 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if we're going to provide a console, it would be more sensible to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide the complete package (along with a framework for command 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parsing etc.) in another (dedicated) add-on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Few reasons I put it in there.
</I>&gt;<i> A - it's done already  ;)  I was doing my animation framework, ended 
</I>&gt;<i> up putting in animated Widgets, and the Animated Console was one of 
</I>&gt;<i> them. B - in my opinion, the console is THE  best debugging tool.
</I>&gt;<i> C - No need for complex parsing - a Console is, fundamentally, much 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler than that.  It's a place to output text, and a place for 
</I>&gt;<i> line-input from the user.  The Console itself doesn't do any parsing, 
</I>&gt;<i> nor should a user of the class be forced to do parsing in any 
</I>&gt;<i> particular way.  My current implementation has a simple callback 
</I>&gt;<i> something like -
</I>
I can follow your reasoning, and especially point A is very convincing. 
Still, I consider the console much like the frontend to a complex 
system, which is exactly what you also said. With the callback 
implementation you posted, putting the console in the GUI add-on is fine 
with me, as the parsing behind can be held very minimal. Even if the 
console class doesn't do it itself, it has to delegate the user input to 
some evaluation instance that's capable of tearing the input apart and 
re-assembling it into a ConsoleCallback. My original concern was, that 
if that evaluation instance grew too complex, the entire console (both 
front- and back-end) should go in an add-on of its own.

&gt;&gt;<i> What isn't clear to me still, is how the entire GUI system will be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrated into the game. Will there be one routine (e.g. in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> singletoned class GUI) that has to be called periodically in the game 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop? Will the GUI system install a thread and run in there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That very much wasn't clear because I very much didn't mention it at 
</I>&gt;<i> all.  ;)  Just a basic class layout.
</I>&gt;<i> I was jotting down ideas in a text file last night as an impromptu 
</I>&gt;<i> design document, but I'm getting sick and I couldn't stay up to finish 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
All the respect that you did it nonetheless :-).

&gt;<i> Theres alot of potential approaches here-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MASkinG approach - call a function in the gui which &quot;takes over&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't return until the GUI is &quot;finished&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GUIChan etc all approach - have one function or a series of functions 
</I>&gt;<i> which the user must call in their main loop to keep driving the GUI
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The windowing toolkit approach (gtk, qt, wx, native) - The GUI is 
</I>&gt;<i> threaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lemme start by saying I don't like the MASkinG approach.  It is 
</I>&gt;<i> incredibly simply to use, but the most inflexible.  It assumes that if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're using the GUI, you aren't doing anything else.  I don't like 
</I>&gt;<i> this assumption because, for me at least, it's never true.
</I>
I also object this approach. As tempting the simplicity may be, it's too 
restrictive.

&gt;<i> Personally I thinking the multithreaded model is ideal and &quot;the holy 
</I>&gt;<i> grail&quot; and I would use it for all of my personal projects.  However I 
</I>&gt;<i> recognize that it has inherent complexity and difficulty to implement 
</I>&gt;<i> and automatically discounts certain platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I'd like to strive for it.  I'd like to develop things such 
</I>&gt;<i> that they can be driven by calling an iterative GUI function in a main 
</I>&gt;<i> loop but can also be driven by a thread when supported.  Since our 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering will always be parallel - based on OpenGL - alot of the 
</I>&gt;<i> limitations of these 2d toolkits don't apply to us and we can easily 
</I>&gt;<i> exploit this flexibility to provide both approaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I like the GUIChan approach but abhore how complex it makes 
</I>&gt;<i> it - if you look at the simplest tutorial for GUIChan it just seems 
</I>&gt;<i> ludicrus.  I think having two simple, magical function such as 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ol::gui::Update()&quot; and &quot;ol::gui::Render()&quot; or something like that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be great.  They could be driven in a main loop manually or put 
</I>&gt;<i> behind the scenes in a thread later on.
</I>
I second you. It would be stupid not to make use of the advantages we 
have at hand. I very much like the two-function-approach, as it keeps 
simple but still flexible enough (so the user can still decide with what 
priority the GUI should be rendered etc.). I'd suggest we dive deeper 
into this.

&gt;&gt;<i> The last (but very sensible) issue I'd like to address is skinning. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It wasn't clear to me from your proposal how that could be achieved. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should account for that from the beginning, as it could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean a major cut in the architecture when installed later on (making 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the whole refactoring process a pain in the butt), even if it isn't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported for a couple of releases. Would you mind elaborating on that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also think it's key.  The native controls obviously can't be skinned 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as the rest of ol::gui so maybe they could be replaced with 
</I>&gt;<i> custom controls MUCH LATER down the line...  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I already said, Gui.hpp was just a dirt basic &quot;class shart&quot;.  Hard 
</I>&gt;<i> to get across my ideas on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There can be a Skin class, and a default instance thereof.  I think 
</I>&gt;<i> the way MASkinG does skins is reasonable - having arrays of bitmaps 
</I>&gt;<i> and colors and fonts with standard indexes for the built-ins and room 
</I>&gt;<i> for custom indexes for the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Window class could have a &quot;applySkin( const Skin&amp; )&quot; method and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;applySkinToChildren( const Skin&amp;)&quot; or something similar and it would 
</I>&gt;<i> pull out elements from the skin it is interested in.  You could then 
</I>&gt;<i> reskin any Window in the hierarchy you wanted, or the Skin class could 
</I>&gt;<i> have an &quot;applyToAll()&quot; method to reskin the entire Window-set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other thoughts on this?
</I>Hm, I'll have to look into MASkinG first, because I don't know how it 
handles this.

Before any further discussion about the implementation details, we maybe 
should get the goals, features and restrictions straight, and build the 
system around that. To make a start:

- Should the GUI support skins at all? (you can skip all further 
questions on answering this with 'no')
- Should the creation of a custom skin be focused on ease, or on maximum 
flexibility?
- Should skins be changeable at runtime?
- Should skins be mixable? (i.e. a few controls of skin A, a few of skin 
B, etc. - I think you get the idea)
- Should a skin affect the looks, the feel, or both of them?

These are a few questions that came to my mind, albeit I'm confident I 
missed a bunch, so feel free to add to the list ;-)

Yours,
  David.
