<PRE>Finally back to business! A lot of interesting discussion going on...

I still have quite hectic time, but it'll calm down eventually.

About supporting SDL, that's in the TODO list. But even now before the 
GlDriver for SDL side is made, separation of Allegro's code from OpenLayer 
has already been under work for some time. Most (all?) of OpenLayer's 
internal code don't depend on AllegroGL directly, but they use it through 
the GlDriver interface. The next step is to make wrapper routines for 
keyboard and mouse, which has been started already, too. Then it's time to 
make a wrapper for a memory image and finally to make a GlDriver for SDL

It's good to hear that the GUI project has started quickly. By the way (I 
don't think I've asked for this before) but I think it'd be great to be able 
to store the GUI and the skins as XML files. That way we'll be able to make 
a WYSIWYG gui builder for OpenLayer, which would even support constructing 
skins, too! That could be a big help for beginners...

Currently the biggest project underway is general Shape &lt;-&gt; Shape 
collisions. I may continue the development now, and after I've finished with 
them I may finally drop my failed Glyph Keeper's OpenGL port and to use 
FreeType directly from OpenLayer. It'd also mean that the compiler issues 
that have came from integrating OpenLayer to GlyphKeeper, especially with 
MSVC and OS X will be gone!

Also when FreeType is used direcly I can finally allow for retrieving 
separate glyphs as Bitmaps, and implementing the interface for custom text 
rendering functions will be possible too.

Then it's time to implement sweeping collisions and advanced textured 
polygons for OpenLayer. What next? ;)
