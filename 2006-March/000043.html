<PRE>This is a long post, get ready!!!

&gt;<i> I like the general idea of that. Would you be willing to let us re-use 
</I>&gt;<i> your (or parts of your) code?
</I>
I'm probably going to be transfering what I've already written over to 
ol::gui as we start getting code down to &quot;paper&quot;  ;)

&gt;<i> 2) I'm missing a spin-edit kind of Control derivative. This might even 
</I>&gt;<i> inherit from TextBox. Nothing too important, really, but I can imagine 
</I>&gt;<i> it would come in handy in many situations.
</I>
Good call - I had a sinking suspiscion there was an &quot;obvious&quot; one 
missing, that may have been it  ;)

I just added &quot;class Spinner&quot; and &quot;class SpinBox&quot;, which combines a 
Spinner and a TextBox

&gt;<i> 3) I'm also kind-of missing a control for tabular output of name&lt;-&gt;value 
</I>&gt;<i> tuples. This might be useful especially for tool development (all kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of editors etc.), and probably also for debugging purposes in-game.
</I>
Hmmmmm  elaborate more on this.  Are you thinking like a basic 
&quot;spreadsheet&quot;-type control with cells that can have arbitrary contents 
and alignment?

&gt;<i> 4) class Console. I think this goes beyond the scope of the GUI. I 
</I>&gt;<i> already have my own console implemented, so I don't mind, but I think if 
</I>&gt;<i> we're going to provide a console, it would be more sensible to provide 
</I>&gt;<i> the complete package (along with a framework for command parsing etc.) 
</I>&gt;<i> in another (dedicated) add-on.
</I>
Few reasons I put it in there.
A - it's done already  ;)  I was doing my animation framework, ended up 
putting in animated Widgets, and the Animated Console was one of them. 
B - in my opinion, the console is THE  best debugging tool.
C - No need for complex parsing - a Console is, fundamentally, much 
simpler than that.  It's a place to output text, and a place for 
line-input from the user.  The Console itself doesn't do any parsing, 
nor should a user of the class be forced to do parsing in any particular 
way.  My current implementation has a simple callback something like -

void ConsoleCallback( std::string command, std::vector&lt; std::string &gt; 
arguments );

but I think that would fit into the Event framework beautifully.

class ConsoleEvent
{
public
   ConsoleEvent( string command, string args );
   string GetCommand();
   vector&lt; string &gt; GetArgs();
};

And whenever the user enters a command, the console posts that event, 
and thats it.  That's all the console does  ;)

&gt;<i> What isn't clear to me still, is how the entire GUI system will be 
</I>&gt;<i> integrated into the game. Will there be one routine (e.g. in a 
</I>&gt;<i> singletoned class GUI) that has to be called periodically in the game 
</I>&gt;<i> loop? Will the GUI system install a thread and run in there?
</I>
That very much wasn't clear because I very much didn't mention it at 
all.  ;)  Just a basic class layout.
I was jotting down ideas in a text file last night as an impromptu 
design document, but I'm getting sick and I couldn't stay up to finish it.

Theres alot of potential approaches here-

MASkinG approach - call a function in the gui which &quot;takes over&quot; and 
doesn't return until the GUI is &quot;finished&quot;

GUIChan etc all approach - have one function or a series of functions 
which the user must call in their main loop to keep driving the GUI

The windowing toolkit approach (gtk, qt, wx, native) - The GUI is threaded.

Lemme start by saying I don't like the MASkinG approach.  It is 
incredibly simply to use, but the most inflexible.  It assumes that if 
you're using the GUI, you aren't doing anything else.  I don't like this 
assumption because, for me at least, it's never true.

Personally I thinking the multithreaded model is ideal and &quot;the holy 
grail&quot; and I would use it for all of my personal projects.  However I 
recognize that it has inherent complexity and difficulty to implement 
and automatically discounts certain platforms.

That said, I'd like to strive for it.  I'd like to develop things such 
that they can be driven by calling an iterative GUI function in a main 
loop but can also be driven by a thread when supported.  Since our 
rendering will always be parallel - based on OpenGL - alot of the 
limitations of these 2d toolkits don't apply to us and we can easily 
exploit this flexibility to provide both approaches.

That said, I like the GUIChan approach but abhore how complex it makes 
it - if you look at the simplest tutorial for GUIChan it just seems 
ludicrus.  I think having two simple, magical function such as 
&quot;ol::gui::Update()&quot; and &quot;ol::gui::Render()&quot; or something like that would 
be great.  They could be driven in a main loop manually or put behind 
the scenes in a thread later on.

&gt;<i> As extension to your original proposal, I suggest a bunch of pre-made 
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs, like a FileOpenDialog, FileSaveDialog, and whatnot. These, of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, utilize the functionality of the base GUI system and do nothing 
</I>&gt;<i> more than provide quick (and easy) access to them.
</I>
I agree, incredibly useful.  I think interfacing with the native 
controls would be a good stopgap way to fill in the functionality &quot;in 
the meantime&quot; but that leads to your next point...

&gt;<i> The last (but very sensible) issue I'd like to address is skinning. It 
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't clear to me from your proposal how that could be achieved. I 
</I>&gt;<i> think we should account for that from the beginning, as it could mean a 
</I>&gt;<i> major cut in the architecture when installed later on (making the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring process a pain in the butt), even if it isn't supported for 
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of releases. Would you mind elaborating on that?
</I>
I also think it's key.  The native controls obviously can't be skinned 
the same as the rest of ol::gui so maybe they could be replaced with 
custom controls MUCH LATER down the line...  ;)

As I already said, Gui.hpp was just a dirt basic &quot;class shart&quot;.  Hard to 
get across my ideas on this.

There can be a Skin class, and a default instance thereof.  I think the 
way MASkinG does skins is reasonable - having arrays of bitmaps and 
colors and fonts with standard indexes for the built-ins and room for 
custom indexes for the user.

The Window class could have a &quot;applySkin( const Skin&amp; )&quot; method and 
&quot;applySkinToChildren( const Skin&amp;)&quot; or something similar and it would 
pull out elements from the skin it is interested in.  You could then 
reskin any Window in the hierarchy you wanted, or the Skin class could 
have an &quot;applyToAll()&quot; method to reskin the entire Window-set.

Any other thoughts on this?
