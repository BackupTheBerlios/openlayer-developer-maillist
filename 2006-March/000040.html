</I>I like the general idea of that. Would you be willing to let us re-use 
your (or parts of your) code?
&gt;<i> So I thought I'd just shoot off this header file to see what any of 
</I>&gt;<i> you think.
</I>After taking a quick glance at the header file, here are my comments:
1) class Frame. As you said, this is way beyond the scope of an initial 
release. Keeping the possibility in mind, however, doesn't sound like a 
bad idea to me.
2) I'm missing a spin-edit kind of Control derivative. This might even 
inherit from TextBox. Nothing too important, really, but I can imagine 
it would come in handy in many situations.
3) I'm also kind-of missing a control for tabular output of name&lt;-&gt;value 
tuples. This might be useful especially for tool development (all kind 
of editors etc.), and probably also for debugging purposes in-game.
4) class Console. I think this goes beyond the scope of the GUI. I 
already have my own console implemented, so I don't mind, but I think if 
we're going to provide a console, it would be more sensible to provide 
the complete package (along with a framework for command parsing etc.) 
in another (dedicated) add-on.
5) The layout managers (see Sizeable etc.) seem complete enough for me. 
I like that.
6) The event system also seems to be complete, I have no further 
comments on that.

What isn't clear to me still, is how the entire GUI system will be 
integrated into the game. Will there be one routine (e.g. in a 
singletoned class GUI) that has to be called periodically in the game 
loop? Will the GUI system install a thread and run in there?

As extension to your original proposal, I suggest a bunch of pre-made 
dialogs, like a FileOpenDialog, FileSaveDialog, and whatnot. These, of 
course, utilize the functionality of the base GUI system and do nothing 
more than provide quick (and easy) access to them.

The last (but very sensible) issue I'd like to address is skinning. It 
wasn't clear to me from your proposal how that could be achieved. I 
think we should account for that from the beginning, as it could mean a 
major cut in the architecture when installed later on (making the whole 
refactoring process a pain in the butt), even if it isn't supported for 
a couple of releases. Would you mind elaborating on that?
&gt;<i> And I'll take this opportunity to ask - there's the oladdons project 
</I>&gt;<i> now but it doesn't make sense to me to seperate discussion of addons 
</I>&gt;<i> into mailing lists there - not yet.  I think since OL is still raw and 
</I>&gt;<i> in constant flux, and for the first few months the development of both 
</I>&gt;<i> is going to be highly intertwined, we should just keep it all here.  
</I>&gt;<i> Any arguments on that note?
</I>The purist thing to do would be to separate the discussions, but I see 
no need for that now. As long as the discussions can benefit from each 
other, they can be put in the same pot, I think. Once they're both 
established enough, we might want to come back to this very point and 
decide whether their ways should part or not.
