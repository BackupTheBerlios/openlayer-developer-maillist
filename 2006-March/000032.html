<PRE>
&gt;<i> I like your proposal of OpenLayer add-ons. It wasn't quite clear to me, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, if such add-on would be compiled into a library of its own 
</I>&gt;<i> (depending on OpenLayer) or if it would be built into the main OpenLayer 
</I>&gt;<i> library.
</I>
When it comes down to it a static library is just &quot;a collection of 
object files&quot; so it would be absolute cake to either build them into the 
main OL library or into seperatre librarys based on a compile time option.

At least with the GCC-family of compilers (pretty much EVERYTHING except 
MSVC) you can even take a preexisting static library and just add more 
object files in as wanted.

Not an issue  :)

&gt;<i> Anyway, this is just a minor issue. I am in favor of creating a project 
</I>&gt;<i> of its own, because that will keep the core OpenLayer stuff concise and 
</I>&gt;<i> clean. Actually, every add-on should get its own repository, or will 
</I>&gt;<i> things get too complicated then?
</I>
I've created the &quot;OpenLayer Add-ons&quot; project.  The project page is 
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/oladdons">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/oladdons</A>

Having a seperate repository for each addon may actually make things 
harder in the long run...

My personal preference would be to put everything into the same /trunk. 
  That way if someone really wanted to check out one addon and not 
others, they could checkout /trunk/[add-on name] and the master header 
for the add-on.

But there could also be multiple trunks, one for each add-on.  HOWEVER, 
I also kind of forsee that different addons will interdepend on each 
other - Add-on A won't work without Add-on B - therefore keeping them 
seperate is kind of silly  ;)

We'll figure that out in the next day or two before i make an initial 
import.
