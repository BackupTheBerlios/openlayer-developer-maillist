<PRE>As this was brought up before, just like to revist it with news. :)
I was discussing on #allegro with Birdee-oh (brady) and others about the 
possibility of just using FreeType2 directly and the difficulty of doing so.
We were referred by someone to check out this simple library that shows how 
easy it is to use freetype:
<A HREF="http://fudgefont.sf.net">http://fudgefont.sf.net</A>
The library simply loads TTF fonts into an Allegro type Font which is also 
useable by AllegroGL. However it doesn't provide kerning support.
Going through the documentation of FreeType2 I found that it with a little 
more work, kerning support and other features are easily adoptable.
Thus I propose we begin work to use FreeType directly so we can slowly 
deprecate the troublesome Glyph Keeper dependency.
Instead of adding more code to TextRenderer, we could create a new class Glyph 
or something akin to that and do everything with FreeType there.
We can also adopt it so that it retains the functionality of GlyphKeeper's 
interface, that way we don't have to break the api of TextRenderer, making it 
transparent to the end user. This will also allow us to expand the 
functionality of TextRender to do more or so the things proposed by Fladimir 
before on being able to manipulate Glyphs directly.
With that in place we can then simply use preprocessors to switch from using 
GlyphKeeper to the new Glyph handler when compiling the library for testing 
until it is stable enough to completely deprecate GlyphKeeper.
What do you think?
