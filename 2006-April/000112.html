<PRE>OK, you guys type faster than I can read these posts ;)

Firstly, there's no such thing as a CollisionPoly, it's a typo in the 
manual. Such thing was planned in the beginning, but things changed.

Secondly, the magic pink conversion might have been broken when all the 
Allegro stuff was moved to neat containers, to allow for SDL targets, for 
example. Why it's not fixed - that's because it hasn't been detected before. 
I originally left out the magic pink conversion in early versions of OL for 
a reason - it's not 80's anymore, guys! Magic pink transparency hasn't been 
used in commercial products like, a dozen of years? For some reason 
allegroids still think it's a good and fresh idea, maybe because Allegro 
uses it. But I know it should be fixed right away, could you just send me 
the images that you can't load?

About the collision polygon generation. Creating the collision polygon 
requires a memory copy of the Bitmap. However, no such thing exist after the 
constructor/Load-method call. So there's no way the sub-bitmap constructor 
would get the memory copy*. However, the flag parameters should be listed in 
the Load methods, I'll go and add them there.

And finally about the Wiki - if someone wants to set one up and somehow move 
the manual there, go ahead ;) I also think that if a Wiki is set up, only 
registered members should be able to modify it...

* Actually, there is, but it won't work with older GFX cards if the image is 
too large
