Subject: [Openlayer-developer] updates to files of OL
Message-ID: <20061021151200.210520@gmx.net>

Hi all, 

I have now made some changes to some files of OL (latest SVN), but of course cannot submit these changes. I've also not compiled them with gcc: Though I installed MinGW 5.0.3, the cbuild build process does not work. Seems that it makes some assumptions about the environment which are different from what I have here. Anyway. 

How to proceed? I could send the modified files to somebody (or all) and explain what I have changed? 

Currently the text rendering does not work on both my PCs, can't figure out why. It's also not possible to use Glyphkeeper with another target than GLYPH_TARGET_ALLEGGL, so I couldn't try anything about that. The AGL examples work fine, except the fonttest, which simply crashes upon loading the first font.

Welcome tobias sorry I couldn't respond earlier I was having some system 
problems in the last 2 days.
About your text rendering problem, try not using GlyphKeeper and use the 
internal renderer. When compiling the code pass -DUSE_NEW_TTF and omit 
linking to glyphkeeper. You do need to make sure you have freetype2 installed 
properly and just link against that. If you like you can can make a patch of 
your changes on the source tree, attach it here and I'll test them out for 
you on gcc.

tobing is the pseudonym, Tobias is my real name. So there's no need to apologize... 

I've attached ol.rar, containing all 7 changed files. 

OlRectangle.hpp and Circle.hpp have a section included, which undefines min and max, if they are defined. 

Bitmap.cpp has loop variables renamed. 

Internal.hpp has different implementations of OlAssert. This code is copied from Neil Walker, from the thread in the forum. 

shapedemo/Main.cpp has two things corrected: END_OF_FUNCTION and to open the correct file. 

textdemo/Main.cpp das an added Canvas::Fill to have a blank black screen to write on, and the ctor of TextRenderer neuropol changed, then call Load explicitely (helps debugging, but maybe should not go into SVN?). 

gamedemo/Demo.cpp has the gcc-only <? statement replaced by something that works for me - what does <? mean? 


Thanks for considering this stuff for updating SVN, hope it works all fine. I'll try to not use GK now...

Ok I gave the changes a whirl and they worked flawlessly with gcc 4.1 on 
linux. All compiled well and all the demos work just the same. Hopefully it 
works just as well on gcc/mingw on windows. :D
Good work neil and tobing. :)

I just tried out the changes on windows mingw and it compiled just as well,
no problems. All demos ran perfectly fine. Flad if you want, I can go ahead
and commit the changes? Let me know, unless you have other
plans/tests to do. :)

Thank you very much. Got the OL update yesterday. 


Two remarks. 

I think that OpenLayer would be a good candidate for a DLL. I would try to make it a DLL, if there's no specific reason to not do so? It might turn out too difficult, but I expect that it would be fine. The advantage might be that the application does not have to link all these libraries which are referenced in OL. 

About coding format. I have since a few years adopted the habit to write each statement into one separate line. The reason is simply that debuggers are line-oriented, and single stepping is so much easier then. The question would be, if you would mind to change the code layout, such that every statement gets its own line? 

The point is, if I would start to make changes to make OL a DLL, I would rather prefer to adhere to that convention. Generally, I would try to write and changes in such a way that they go seamless into existing code, but the one-statement-one-line-rule would be important to me. 

Anyway, doing this DLL stuff will take its time, so there's no hurry to have an ultra-fast decision here. I would like to hear your comments though.

I remember that one OL user had made the library to compile as a DLL before 
(I think it was of version 1.8, which is old now), but he never posted me 
the code. I'm not sure what you mean by one statement per line. I don't 
think there's many places where that's not true, or is there? If the changes 
aren't drastical, I won't mind :)

All he means is where you might have:

if(a==2) dosomething();

change it to:
if(a==2) 
	dosomething();

That way you can trace into the debugger easier and set breakpoints.

Hi,

The Font-class doesn't contain any name for the font. Thus, it'd be 
difficult to generate any sensible name for the saved font. In fact, the 
Font class doesn't contain any information that could be used to "save" the 
font in the theme XML file (as <font systemName="arial" size="20" />).

Also, I noticed this: height = texHashMap.get('a').getHeight();

I'd say that's not very accurate. And if the character set doesn't have the 
letter A in it (for example, a chinese font) that would go crashing down.

It's the same with Pixmaps. There's no way to know how the texture is 
retrieved...

So is tobing going to be added to the svn developer list? If those are just
cosmetical changes he can go ahead and commit them himself.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] Canvas clipping
Message-ID: <7d8be2250610241759w7dad80e6w7490fa4017e2d32@mail.gmail.com>

Two concerns with clipping. When calling SetClipping is there any specific
reason why this code block is necessary?:
if( !clippingRegions.empty() ) {
clippingRegion = clippingRegions.top();
}
if( x < clippingRegion.x ) {
w -= clippingRegion.x - x;
x = clippingRegion.x;
}

if( y < clippingRegion.y ) {
h -= clippingRegion.y - y;
y = clippingRegion.y;
}

if( x + w > clippingRegion.w ) {
w = clippingRegion.w - x;
}

if( y + h > clippingRegion.h ) {
h = clippingRegion.h - y;
}

Reason I ask is because I've ran some tests and have had some clipping
regions shrunk/modified from the actual size region I passed. I built canvas
without it and the passed clipping regions are unmodified and are set as
expected.

The other concern is GetClippingRegion. I mentioned it before but if the
stack is empty the function will die and crash the program. I made a change
which I can apply that checks if the stack is empty:
Rect Canvas::SurfaceInfo::
GetClippingRegion() {
if(!clippingRegions.empty())
{
const OlRectangle< int > &clippingRegion = clippingRegions.top();
return Rect( clippingRegion.x, clippingRegion.y, clippingRegion.w,
clippingRegion.h );
}
else
{
return Rect( 0, 0, Width(), Height() );
}
}

Thanks.

It was intended to clip the region to the edges of the screen. But it 
appears that it's not necessary, so now it's removed.

Yeah, I totally forgot that :) I committed your changes.

Subject: [Openlayer-developer] Using 8 bpp bitmap as alpha channel.
Message-ID: <45434263.5000509@gmx.net>

Hello there!

I was wondering if/how it was possible to use an 8bpp bitmap as an alpha
channel. The situation is this: we only need the alpha channel, and for
now we're wasting 24 bpp. Granted, it works, but it's by far not the
solution I want.

One improvement would be to allow a 8bpp bitmap file to be loaded and
"deflated" into a 32bpp in memory - it still wastes 24 bpp in memory,
but at least the required harddisk footprint isn't as huge.

The next (and best) thing would be, of course, if both on harddisk and
in memory only the channel that is actually needed exists.

Ideas/comments?

Yours,
   David.

P.S.: In case you're wondering, that's for a static shadowmap ;)

That may already be possible if you set a proper palette in Allegro.

8-bit textures are possible, but may not be supported with all hardware. For 
example, the text routines originally used 8-bit textures, but I changed 
them to 32 bpp for compability reasons.
